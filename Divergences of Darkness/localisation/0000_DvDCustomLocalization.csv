lessons_of_the_german_revolution_desc;The German Revolution was a event that took place in Frankfurt in the late 18th Century that had been utterly crushed after several catastrophic failures from its leadership.

AZL_annexation_INC_desc;The Incan Empire had never been fully conquered by Spanish Conquistadors and that has allowed it to spread its influence like a petulant disease across the whole of Western Ameriga.

BAV_constitutionalism_desc;The Bavarian Constitution as written during the Liberal Revolutions of the mid 19th Century was notably Liberal in comparison to most other efforts in Europe during this period. It is said that this constitution was authored by survivors from the Great German Wars whom saw a chance to influence policy in this normally conservative kingdom in the centre of Europe. Of course, most agree that none of the great powers in the region particularly liked the idea of Bavaria going down the path of liberalism but nobody would attempt to directly intervene or potentially risk yet another Great German War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CONGR15.D;The Kingdom of Hungary-Austria has defeated all its enemies, maintained its territorial stability and has effectively become the new defender of the Balkans. This has unsurprisingly upset the balance of power in Europe. The Great Powers have assembled in $CAPITAL$ on the behest of $COUNTRY$ to put aside their grudges temporalily and establish a new set of international laws to avoid one state to take too much power at the expense of the others. It is the beginning of a new era for international relations and hopefully for peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

selon_stagnation;Selon Treaty Stagnation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
selon_stagnation_desc;The Selon Treaty has granted specific protections to Asian Nations that prevents rapid-fire conquest of our territory. This has resulted in stagnation for the entire continent and no real effort to "civilize" is being taken by anyone with the sheer exception of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME95620;The Selon Stagnation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC95620;The Treaty of Selon was signed by Burgundy, Spain, England-France and Scandinavia in the 18th Century, guaranteeing peaceful and trade-oriented development of European power projection in the Far East. This very treaty ensures that Asian nations cannot be directly attacked or turned into protectorates by European nations and has resulted in a sense of peace and security from European interests. This has resulted in a lack of care to "civilize" by almost all Asian nations with the exceptions of both Japan and Korea and may result in future foreign policy disasters..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME95621;Selon Treaty Abolished;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC95621;The Treaty of Selon has been abolished and whatever protections that it granted over Asian Nations has gone with it. A sense of panic has erupted in $COUNTRY$ as many officials have already concluded that our inability to civilize due to the existence of this extremely valuable treaty will leave us open to attack by European Nations. India, of course has it far worse as hungry eyes look towards the opulence of the subcontinent and its enduring chaos that can be easily explored for easy protectorates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME32305;The border incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32305;Our sphere master either has cultural minorities or well justified claims over a portion of our territory. However they came about these claims is unknown but it has been creating serious border tension recently. Today, there was a serious border incident involving several of their soldiers and ours. Our sphere master has already withdrawn its embassy and it looks like all possible options to maintain the peace have now officially ended. A war is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME32306;The incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32306;One of our sphere members has killed several of our soldiers in a unjustified attack on our border outpost. As we have several claims on their territory, the tensions in these "cores" have only continued to increase beyond that of having a ability to actually maintain our sphere over this country. Additionally, many cry out for us to crush their army to prove that we are able to take our rightful territory back and we are not too pacifist to have any reasonable stake as a world power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
GRE95.T;The Greek Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GRE95.D;Greece had waged a war of liberation against Venice and had somehow succeeded in liberating themselves from its control. However, in the process of doing so they had been given a taste of nationalism and have critically damaged our efforts to ever hope to hold this territory in the name of the Turkish people ever again. The fragments of the Greek government have come together to forge a compromise that would allow a Greek nation to exist but for us to still keep political control over it while protecting the Turkish people from harm. Alternatively of course we could just ignore the compromise and keep the land, but that will have serious consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106095.A;To protect our people in Greece we shall abide by this compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

end_regency_desc;Our government has very little legitimacy and is likely to fall into republicanism and chaos in the near future. The empire must be restored under a new semi-democratic regime that's kept under Janissary Control or risk complete collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE72.D;With the Bohemian Dynasty overthrown, the Holy Roman Empire ceases to exist and rather in its place stands a new German Nation. Let the German Eagle rise! Unfortunately, whatever is left of the Bohemian Monarchy has retreated to the original crown-lands of Bohemia and has declared independence. We cannot contest this because we have very little claim over this land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BOH_planB_title;Plan B;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH_planB_desc;With our inability to recover our imperial lands before the Springtime of Nations, we have been left in a situation where we are unable to recover the German territories that should be in our control and not Scandinavia due to international laws. However, there are some in our government who feel that we should just ignore international laws and claim it under whatever is left of the crown of the Holy Roman Empire regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH_planK_title;Seize the Canal Zone;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH_planK_desc;It is unacceptable that another nation is permitted to build a canal with the purposes of giving a alternative path into the Baltic Sea. Under the risk of having our potential Baltic Trade damaged, they force our hand and we are forced to take a effort to seize the canal zone for ourselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HRE76.T;The end of Plan B;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HRE76.D;Plan B has ended in a smashing success! Scandinavia has been thrown out of Germany and we have come as liberators rather then conquerors. However, our ability to keep this territory may be limited by the fact that we are currently still the Kingdom of Bohemia. If we were to form some form of Confederation between the Elbian states that may change, but as it currently stands we are not permitted to keep our claims over the territory (nor is Scandinavia either for that matter)...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unite_turkestan_desc;The concept of a Greater Turania which includes territories that are now a part of the new chinese conquests has been time and time again proven to be a utter impossibility that only a madman would dream of. So we shall limit ourselves to a state of Turkmen, Kyrgyz, Tajiks and Uzbeks that can be united into the concept of a Lesser Turania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_turkestan_title;Form Lesser Turania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_turkestan_desc;The various cultures of Central Asia would serve us better if they were united as one nation. The fledgling nationalism of these peoples, oftentimes part of nomadic tribes, is something of a recent and small phenomenon. Therefore the people shouldn't oppose the creation of Turania and their inclusion in this nation. The local elites may protest such a move, but guaranteeing them a share of power in the new country will silence the vast majority of the potential troublemakers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER43.T;Unification?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The present and most bloody stage of this war has raged on since Eighteen-Forty-Two and Lusitania has finally given up being friendly towards our cause and declared a separate republic in the hope that if they defeat us then they shall not be annexed by Spain again.

CLM71.D;As Gran Columbia nears its fiftieth anniversary, a fiery debate has started in our government regarding if Gran Columbia should move its capital or not.

CLM72.D;It has been fifty years since the foundation of the Tetrarchy that had reorganized the Columbian Alliance into a single unified nation. This nation had prevailed against both Spain and its own instabilities to become the single unified power it that it is today. However, there is now a critical concern that as the century continues our power is starting to decline and that the Inca and Arcadian powers will eventually surpass us. We must also be concerned at the growing nationalist movements in both Lusitania and Granada are threatening to tear our nation to pieces with the implicit agenda of deciding where our capital shall be located regardless of any potential compromise. We must choose where we stand on the idea of the capital moving and what our intent is regarding future expansion IMMEDIATLY or risk our potential collapse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME125131;Sunset over Rebellions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC125131;The Ottoman Civil War lasted for more than 30 years. And now it is over. We have saved what we could, but the damage has been made. Will the Empire find its place under the sun again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA125131;Farewell, you traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME125132;The New Ottoman Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC125132;The Phanariote Societies have brought peace to the Ottoman Empire after decades of war and have established systems to ensure that the Ottoman Sultan will be unable to effectively further enact any reforms that directly damage the influence of these societies. However, sacrifices for stability must be made and the ability for the Ottoman Empire to reconquer any lands lost in the Civil War would now be rendered impossible though the means of reforms that are implicitly racist against the minority groups that has ensured the downfall of the Empire. Some say that these same reforms may also cause instability within the remaining territory inside the Porte but these claims have ultimately been dismissed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC125133;WARNING: THIS LOCKS RECONQUEST DECISIONS. With the complete success of the Phanariote Societies in the Ottoman Empire. It seems that they are ready to establish their new political systems and ensure the future stability of the Ottoman Empire regardless of the potential aggression between minority groups that that this could create. For now the Sultan would be locked away inside his palace until the society has officially brought peace to the Ottoman Empire and the Army of Faith shall destroy all enemies to the Ottoman State! Huzzah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TURREB.T;Defeat of the Phanariotes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TURREB.D;The Phanariote Societies that have torn this Empire to pieces in the past couple of decades have finally been utterly defeated! Unable to capitalize on their successful Anatolian uprising their movement has been routed and cities are each day welcoming us as their new saviours. The main leaders have been captured and beheaded, their heads thrown into the Bosporus. We have captured their arsenals and supplies to help for the war effort It is likely we won’t see another rebellion soon : most of the populations are weary and only want peace after decades of war. It is time to finish the still ongoing wars for the better or the worse and let the peoples of our empire rest at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

newworld_immigration_blocker;The Nightmare in the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
newworld_immigration_blocker_desc;For hundreds of years, the new world was considered a bastion of adventure and freedom from being a citizen of a european nation. However, as the empires have broken down the region has become a quagmire of endless conflicts and insanity of which almost nobody could have seen coming. Peace would have to reign once again for the new world to be considered a safe place once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95622;The Nightmare in the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95622;For hundreds of years, the new world was considered a bastion of adventure and freedom from being a citizen of a European nation. However, as immigrants arrive in the new world in the aftermath of the Great German Wars: they find a continent that is perpetually locked in endless wars with either colonial powers or between themselves. This information has been slowly spread around the whole world and it is universally agreed upon that it would better to stay in Europe then run the risk of being trapped in bloody nightmare that is the new world. It would take a period of relative peace to break this reputation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95623;The Nightmare is Over;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95623;A sense of relative peace has passed over the new world as most major post-colonial conflicts have been resolved in one way or another. Immigrants have started to trickle in once again and many scholars are already starting to consider this the next great golden age of immigration into the new world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
initial_amerigan_immigration;Atlantia Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
initial_amerigan_immigration_desc;The existence of Atlantia as being a illegal part of the Federation of Amazonia has left immigrants wondering if they should attempt to immigrate to the region until the crisis has been resolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT1.T;Federation of Amazonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT1.D;The Amazonian Federation declared independence in 1825 among the chaotic events in Europe and Columbia and has maintained relative stability even if there has been friction with Equinoxia and its refusal to compromise with Slave Holders. However, its first action of foreign policy was to seize the region of Atlantia during the Lotharigia Civil War. A action which has not been recognized by anyone in Ameriga and was considered nothing more then a deliberately aggressive act to cement its hold on the continent. If Lotharingia were to stabilize, there may be a final war to decide the fate of Atlantia in the Amazonian Federation and it may be likely that we will fail to keep it. However, if we did win this war then the region would be recognized as our own and Lotharigia will likely be unable to rise against us ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT1.A;Amazonia Forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT2.T;Oriental Republic of Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT2.D;Once a colony of the Kingdom of Burgundy, Lotharingia is well recognized as one of the first post-colonial Amerigan nations (with the exception of the Kingdom of Beronia). However, the fact that a large portion of the wealthy population still believed in European monarchist ideas would ultimately doom this young nation into a civil war. The "Loyalist Government" would ultimately prevail in this civil war but Atlantia would be lost to Amazonia and it would have no intent to rejoin a dictatorial government. Some members of the Lotharingian Congress are already considering making a compromise with the remaining monarchists and land owners that would allow for democratic rule once again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT2.A;We will recover Atlantia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT3.T;The Monarchist Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT3.D;Lotharingia had devolved into a civil war after the republic failed upon the election of a monarchist to the Presidency. Still, the tensions continue and it is likely that there may be even another revolt if we fail to fix this monarchist issue at some point. So, a compromise must be made with the Monarchists and the current ruling Dictatorship or we may never be able to reconquer the territory of Atlantia. Alternatively we can just ignore the requests of the monarchists and try and reconquer Atlantia without them, but it will likely be extremely difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT3.A;Establish the Constitutional Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT3.B;Execute these traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT4.T;Denis de Aigle's Glorious Reconquest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT4.D;The President has declared that all men, women and children must be involved in what should be considered as the rightful glorious reconquest of Atlantia. In turn, the Congress has voted with a one hundred and ten percent majority to declare war on Amazonia and mobilize all possible citizens. This will be the final chance for Lotharingia to retake what is rightfully theirs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT4.A;Hallelujah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.T;The Atlantia Counter-Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.D;The region of Atlantia had refused to deal with the monarchists and had declared its independence from Lotharingia before being promptly annexed by Amazonia a decade ago. However, as Lotharingia has become a Constitutional Monarchy with more power to the people rather then the Kings. Many in Atlantia have been questioning why they should stay with a former colony of the Dual-Monarchy that did not even want to declare independence for a extremely extended period of time and rather join with their monarchist, but at least democratic brethren in Lotharingia. This question has come to a head today as Atlantia has now officially declared succession from the federation and has immediately rejoined the Oriental Kingdom of Lotharingia to the utter shock of everyone in $CAPITAL$. We could either act upon this and fight for land that is not even rightfully ours according to the rest of the continent or should we just give up the land and allow Lotharingia to keep it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.A;Send the Ultimatum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT5.B;They can keep it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.T;Amazonian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.D;The government of the Amazonian Federation has presented a ultimatum regarding the succession of Atlantia from their nation. We must immediately revoke all claims to the territory and not attempt to fight the Amazonian Army when it attempts to occupy the region of Atlantia for the second time or we will be declared war upon and forced to relinquish this territory by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.A;We will not give into their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT6.B;We cannot fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT7.T;The Monarchy Collapses;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT7.D;Whatever prestige the monarchy had after losing this extremely critical war to Amazonia was effectively destroyed today as a rather large amount of citizens barged their way into the Royal Palace and executed the king in his own bedroom before proclaiming a new democratic republic. The military has attempted to restore order by countering these large mobs of citizens with arms fire but the conflict has turned out to be bloody and long as the mobs have broken into the general staff headquarters. If the general staff is destroyed it is unlikely that the military will be able to successfully restore the loyalist government, but there is a equal chance that the mobs will be dispersed before it comes to that. At this point, victory is up in the air for either faction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT7.A;The military successfully disperses the mobs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

VAL42.T;A strange letter;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL42.D;We have recieved a strange letter from the Duchy of Parma requesting that we appoint a member of the Farnese Dynasty as a General. The individual in question is Antonio Farnese, a abnormally young pick to be a general but it seems that he is nothing less then a absolute genius in every regard. The only reason they sent him to us is because "his ambitions would not be suited to a duchy which is unlikely to survive the next liberal uprising". Your choice, King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL43.T;The Duchy of Parma and Antonio Farnese;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL43.D;Antonio Farnese is a heir to the Duchy of Parma. Not a direct heir none-the-less but still one that we can crown as the Duke of Parma and give legitmacy to our ownership of the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL44.T;The Liberal Revolution and Antonio Farnese;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL44.D;When the news that europe had erupted into a liberal revolution, unseen since the infamous german revolutions ultimately arrived at the court of the King of Provence. The General, Antonio Farnese immediatly presented a list of demands to the court stating that if they are not heeded, it is likely that this country may find itself annexed by the Dual Monarchy or even worse: made a republic. Universal Voting, A full parliament, rights and liberties to be given to each and every citizen. Insanity, but he is a genius after all. We should consider listening to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL45.T;The Inevitable Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL45.D;Antonio Farnese had taken over every single aspect of the Provencal Army inside of a few years after he was granted his title. If the King of Provence would refuse to comply with his orders then he would very quickly take things into his own hands and ensure that there would be a Valois King listening to his demands. The demands that were previously refused have been accepted as the King has been replaced by someone more willing to listen to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL46.T;Prime Minister Antonio Farnese;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL46.D;The Kingdom of Italy has been created under our rule and yet Antonio Farnese had clearly not had enough power in this new government. He has been appointed as Prime Minister, but at this point we might as well just consider it "Prime Minister for Life" because there is literally no way that anyone could ever hope to compete with his ability to manipulate himself into any position....;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL47.T;The Endgame - The Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL47.D;Before the Valois Dynasty was able to get comfortable at the fact that they are now the Kings of France and Italy. Antonio Farnese abruptly declared the end of valois rule and the fact that since he righfully conquered the realm for the Valois Dynasty, that he indeed was righfully the EMPEROR of France-Italy. Nobody disagreed with him, not even the parliament that he dissolved with the help of the military. So, upon this day the Valois dynasty ends and the rise of the Farnese Dynasty is upon us. All hail his glorious majesty, Emperor Antonio the First of the French-Italian Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL48.T;The Endgame - The Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL48.D;Before the Valois Dynasty was able to get comfortable at the fact that they are now the Kings of France.

All hail his glorious majesty, Emperor Antonio the First of the French Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL49.T;General Antonio Farnese is dead;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL49.D;After a long and relatively unsucessful career, Antonio Farnese has passed away at the ripe old age of Eighty-One. There is no telling how far his potencial ambition would have gone if we were more successful but its clear that the Valois Dynasty continues to be a waste of space in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL50.T;Prime Minister Antonio Farnese is dead;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL50.D;After a highly successful career, Antonio Farnese has passed away at the ripe old age of Eighty-One. The Prime Minister has lead Italy though a golden age of culture and wealth, but highly undemocratic policies. He shall be remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL51.T;Emperor Antonio I is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL51.D;Europe finally has a sigh of relief today as the monster from the west has finally died of old age. As he was eternally busy, he has left no heirs and since he also butchered most of the Valois Dynasty after taking power to prevent any of them from trying to take the country from him. He has basically left $COUNTRY$ in a state of eternal regency which is unlikely to end for quite a while. Who knows whom they will choose, if the monarchy survives the aftermath of his death. Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL52.T;Antonio Farnese is dead;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL52.D;After a last stand against the Republican Revolutionaries. The man whom many know as Antonio Farnese is dead, and so goes whatever remaining ambitions the insane imperialist scum had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

POL11.T;The Polish Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL11.D;The creation of the Russian Empire might have been a proud moment for Russia, if not for the fact that its influence towards the Slavic people is limited due to the existence of a disgusting barely-stable mess of a "nation" known as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. We could easily persuade the nations of Central Europe that a "partition" is in order to increase the stability of Eastern Europe and ensure that there will be peace in our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222390.A;Send a message to the Czech.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL12.T;The Polish Question - Response;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL12.D;Russia has sent a letter in regards to the fate of the Commonwealth. A letter which proclaims that with the present existence of the highly unstable Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the entirely stability of Eastern Europe is indeed threatened by its existence. The Polish are our west Slavic brothers but we do agree with Russia at least in regards to the fact the Commonwealth is highly unstable and needs to be stablized by external means immediatly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222391.A;The Russians are right. Begin the proceedings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222391.B;The Russians are insane. We shall have no part in this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL13.T;The Polish Question - A ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL13.D;We have been sent a letter from the Russian Empire and any interested German State on the matter of our national stability. We are to immediately remove our army from our borders and be... freely invaded by them. They will then call a Sjem on the matter of "A Polish Partition" which will put "Unstable Territories" in the care of approprate nations. We will be permitted to keep Lithuania as a intergrated part of the Commonwealth but it is likely we will lose Posen, The Cossacks, Belarus, Prussia and Pomerelia. If we refuse they will take military action, All of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222392.A;We have no choice. If we tried to fight it is likely that we would be utterly destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222392.B;The Commonwealth shall not stand by and allow this to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL14.T;The First Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL14.D;A Sjem has been called in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by external nations regarding the stability of its territories. It (the Sjem) has concluded that the current state of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is unacceptable and that its territories must be reorganized according to the wishes of the various external nations (the removal of Posen, The Cossacks, Belarus, Prussia and Pomerelia and the annexation of Lithuania into the Commonwealth proper). Critics of this event are calling it a blatant attempt by Russia and Central European powers to annex Commonwealth territory and that it will not increase the stablity of Easten Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222393.A;The bear better not come back for seconds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL15.T;Partition Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

POL17.T;A Second Partition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL17.D;We have left Poland in a exceptionally weak state after the first partition and so this may be our chance to finally dissolve the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for good with little or no cost to us at all. Since we made the approprate modifications to their constitution during the first Partition Sjem, it will be quite literally impossible for them to fight back against us this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222396.A;Send a letter to the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222396.B;We did enough in the First Partition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL19.T;The Second Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL19.D;The Government of Polish-Lithuania was left with a fatal flaw after the first partition. Placed implicitly in their constitution was the line that stated that if at any point an external power needs to dissolve the commonwealth as a matter of european stablity, then they shall be permitted to do so. At the time the Commonwealth had agreed on the provision that no nation shall use it unless the situation is urgent but Russia in its unnaturally belligrent way had decided to use it regardless. Before the commonwealth was able to do anything about the clause, troops had already marched across its border and ceased the approprate territory required to effectively dissolve the commonwealth. The Union of Lublin is broken. The Commonwealh is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

POL20.T;The Creation of Galicia-Lodomeria ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL20.D;We have been given a large chunk of Poland as a result of the Second Partition of Poland. As it is impossible to adminstrate territory which is majority polish due to the already catastropic tensions in the East, we have created a nation called Galicia-Lodomeria to adminstrate this territory for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

POL22.T;The Destruction of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL22.D;Several years after the First and Second partitions of Poland, it has been made abundantly clear that Polish nationalism is nothing less then a extreme threat to Russian stability and that the concept of Poland as a whole is doing nothing more then weakening our nation state and allowing us to be threatened by outside nations. It is time to end our facade of ever caring about the plight of the Polish people and rather taking the path of utterly dissolving the Polish nation from existance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222401.A;Poland shall die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222401.B;This is insanity. Stop! Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL23.T;The Final Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL23.D;Russia has presented us with a ultimatum to immediately surrender our sovereignty to them in a act of blatant imperialism. If we surrender then Poland is effectively a dead nation, ready to be replaced by whatever puppet state that the Russians have come up with to replace Poland. If we don't surrender, we will be invaded and forced to fight a futile war. Its time for the final stand of Poland, are you willing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

222402.B;POLAND IS NOT YE.... what do you mean they own our economy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL24.T;Poland Wins;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL24.D;In a crushing blow for Russian prestige, Poland and its allies have defeated the Russian Army and prevented the final parttion of poland. However, it is likely that we have set a precedent regarding this third partition and Poland is unlikely to survive for much longer. So we just have to wait long enough for Poland to cease existing via the influence of another outside power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
222403.A;Poland is not yet lost. For now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL25.T;The Third Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL25.D;The Russian Army has marched into Warsaw and demanded the complete dissolution of the Polish nation and the effective destruction of the entire Polish idenity. Upon this day, Poland has now ceased to exist and has been replaced by a nation known just as "Warsaw" which has been made a puppet of $COUNTRY$. This is the final and inevitable conclusion to the Polish Partitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

POL26.T;The Third Partition of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
POL26.D;With effective economic and political control over Poland, $COUNTRY$ has demanded the complete dissolution of the Polish nation and the effective destruction of the entire Polish identity.

GER32.T;A third German council?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER32.D;It is a new century and South Germany remains a shattered and broken mess of various German princely states. As new ideologies and concepts spread though Europe, it may be possible to attempt a third German council with the relative ease of the north and Burgundy understanding our intentions this time rather then being inherently fearful of our democratic state. A union of South German states that is created to starve off concepts such as the third way or even communism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GER33.T;Third German Council in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER33.D;There was never any hope for the aspirations of the liberals whom attended the Second German Council. The nation that the council had fabricated had been utterly destroyed by the old rulers of Germany whom intended to maintain the status quo, either though a continuation of their old order or the creation of a North German confederation. However, as the turn of the century has arrived and the political situation in the Germany has continued to change: $COUNTRY$ has declared a third council in a attempt to unify the remaining disparate states of South Germany and least create some semblance of what the original councils could have created.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HLR_claim_AUS_title;Austrian Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
HLR_claim_AUS_desc;With the collapse of Hungary-Austria, it is now possible for us to add Austria to our southern protectorate along with Bavaria. When we integrate Bavaria completely into the Holy Roman Empire, it should also be possible to integrate Austria along with it. Which in turn would add the entirety of both major southern princely states to the Holy Roman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

integrate_BAV_desc;We had agreed in the treaty signed at the end of the Council of Prague to leave Bavaria in a somewhat autonomous state. We had agreed on the provision that under no circumstances would it be advisable to annex this state considering its nature of being the centre of revolution in Germany. However, with the rise of new extreme ideologies in Europe. It should be now possible to prevent any liberal republicans or nationalists to be any threat to our regime over Bavaria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE77.T;A Council in Prague?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE77.D;There have been serious unfortunate events in Central Europe that have left many minor German states wondering if their autonomy is still relevant in this modern world. They look to the strongest state in Central Europe as perhaps a unifying force that may allow them to not fall to either republicanism or other forms of extremism. For a short moment in the history of this Empire it may be possible to come to a agreement with the princes and at least partially unify the decaying remains of the Holy Roman Empire if not a full unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

410077.B;Bohemia does not need to make deals with irrelevant nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE78.T;The Council of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE78.D;The condition of Germany has become intolerable for the King of Bohemia and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. After a catastrophe which has resulted in damage to the the legitimacy of this title, it has been made abundantly clear that the old order is breaking down and being rebuilt in the image of various liberal or foreign groups. A council has been called in Prague to attempt to resolve these various issues and conflicts between the various princes and groups of the Holy Roman Empire and perhaps even allow for the centralization of the Holy Roman Empire or a alternative centralized state if that is deemed impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410078.A;This is going to be messy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE79.T;The Rhine Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE79.D;Burgundy has reminded us of the treaty that was signed in the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine and that this Council is a violation of that treaty. The Confederation agrees with Burgundy and it is unlikely that they will agree with the unification of the Holy Roman Empire under any circumstances. Even if such a unification is agreed upon by this council, the Rhineish states would prefer to keep their autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410079.A;We have to respect this or risk a war with Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE80.T;A futile claim?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE80.D;The Holy Roman Empire was a state that was often heavily tied into the legitimacy of its emperor. The present emperor no longer has any power over his own state, let alone the empire any more. Council members have presented the argument that should such a old state be resurrected if there is no true emperor to rule it any more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410080.A;The Emperor is still the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE81.T;The Scandinavian Objection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE81.D;As expected, Scandinavia has presented their opinion that any attempt to centralize either the Holy Roman Empire or any North German State will likely result in an immediate war. As Scandinavia is considered once of the great powers of europe, many council members are wary of the extremely destructive nature of such a potencial war that could occur if the council voted for centralization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410081.A;The Lion of the North cannot scare the Lion of the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE82.T;Hungary-Austria Responds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE82.D;The Empire of Hungary-Austria has stated that they are the protectors of all South Germans and Danubian Peoples and that no other state should attempt to claim their lands as belonging to any other empire, regardless if it was the the inheritors of rome or any form of german empire. As we have no councillors from Austria at this meeting. It is clear that they have no intent to participate and that somewhat further de-legitimises this meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410082.A;That state should not even exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE83.T;The South is Tamed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE83.D;The southern princes of Bavaria and Austria are both heavily weakened though turmoil in the region and have countless rivals that consist of practically everyone else in the region. As such we have concluded that it would be extremely easy to persuade the councillors of both Austria and Bavaria to vote for the full centralization of the Holy Roman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410083.A;Easy Prey;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE84.T;Pommerania is Safe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE84.D;Scandinavia has failed to penetrate the north in recent years and that has given relative comfort to the various princes in north germany. The council members have taken to the stage to outright praise the Bohemian King for his continued protection of the northern region against the dastardly Scandinavians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410084.A;Germany shall never be their domain again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE85.T;The Revolutionary Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE85.D;The primary cause of this council was that of the extreme threat of the Republican Danubian Federation. Many princes are willing to set aside various differences if only to fight the potential threat that comes from these Republican Revolutionaries! At this point centralization is inevitable unless it is proven that the Bohemian King is utterly incompetent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410085.A;The Great German War shall be repeated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE86.T;The Scandinavian Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE86.D;Scandinavia has claimed the entire northern portion of Germany and have effectively rendered themselves a extreme threat to all North Germans. There is very little that could prevent complete unification at this point due to the absolute threat that the Scandinavians pose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410086.A;We shall conquer all the way to Jutland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE87.T;The Council of Prague - Total Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE87.D;The Council of Prague has ended in utter failure. Reports coming out of the council state that it had practically devolved into a barrage of insults thrown at the Bohemian King-Emperor and his utter inability for him and his nation to do anything to protect the empire against outside threats. It is expected that this will only hasten the complete collapse of the Holy Roman Empire and for Bohemia to effectively fade into international irrelevance without drastic action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410087.A;Traitors! Dogs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE88.T;The Council of Prague - Elbian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE88.D;The Council of Prague has ended with a agreement to form an Elbian Confederation between all cooperative North German States and Bohemia. The compromise required to reunite the Holy Roman Empire was effectively deemed impossible by the council due to the endless revolutions and the rise of German nationalism throughout central europe but a alternative compromise could be found between the remaining Elbian and North Rheinish princes to treat them as equals under the Bohemian Crown and create a new Elbian Confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE90.T;The Council of Prague - Successful;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE90.D;The Council of Prague has ended with a agreement to centralize the Holy Roman Empire. It is clear that this is nothing less then a shock to any european country seeking ambitions over the valuable territories of central europe and expecting that the Holy Roman Empire would decay to a point where it would simply no longer exist under the threat of both German nationalism and liberal revolutions. Even with the signing of a treaty that promises autonomy to Bavaria and does not include the territories of the Confederation of the Rhine, Europe still trembles at the idea of a reborn Holy Roman Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HRE93.T;Betrayal of the Rhine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE93.D;Our betrayal of the Rhineland by refusing to negotiate with Burgundy would not be without consequences. All local governments of the Rhine have simply refused to attend this council and due to their failure to attend it is unlikely that we will make any traction towards a complete unification of the Holy Roman Empire. Alternative arrangements will have to be made if that is still possible under the conditions of this present council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE94.T;The Burgundian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HRE94.D;Burgundy has presented a letter to this Council stating that even by attempting this Council we are UTTERLY betraying the order as established after the Great German Wars. If we attempt any form of unification or centralization of the Holy Roman Empire then there WILL be war with whatever state results from this council and they will do ANYTHING they can to dissolve that state. Many princes shrugged off this ultimatum but others are very concerned that if we continue this council we could start a war with Burgundy and that could only result in Bohemia being left in a worse state then it currently is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BRG01.T;The Kingdom of Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG01.D;"A kingdom without reason, without culture, without purpose" - Louis XII, King of the Dual Monarchy. The Kingdom of Burgundy is a state that was formed out of the feudal realms of the Duchy of Burgundy. Modern Burgundy can trace back its creation to the Congress of Arras, a event in which the Duke of Burgundy demanded a high price for swearing fealty to the French Crown which ultimately resulted in its complete independence due to the latter being annexed by the Kingdom of England. Centuries would pass and Burgundy would only grow in strength and power as both the Holy Roman Empire and Dual Monarchy were unable to interrupt its rise in any reasonable way. The most recent (and relevant) event was that of the Great German War (or German Revolution) in which liberal forces attempted to create a independent Republic of Germany. The fury of these revolutionaries would damage the status quo in Burgundy and force the formation of a autonomous "Duchy of the Rhine" which exists as a puppet state of the Burgundian Crown that ultimately awaits annexation when Burgundy has no reason to abide by the treaty that formed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG02.D;Burgundy has sent us a letter stating that we must make a deal regarding the region of Champagne or risk: "unforeseen invasion" by Burgundian Forces. We have a few options in regards to dealing with this crisis: 1. We can refuse and attempt to fight the Burgundian Army, 2. We can give the land away or 3. We can create the "Duchy of Champagne" as a autonomous vassal to snub the Burgundians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG23.T;Anne II's Prerogative;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG23.D;Queen Anne II has decided that with the beginning of the second wave of European Liberal Revolutions, she should use her prerogative to reorganize the Estates-General with the intent to prevent any potential liberal revolts in Burgundy. Members of the Parti Réformiste and Democratische Partij both left the chamber in utter disgust at the blatant abuse of power by the Queen but are ultimately left unable to take any action without practically resigning their positions. However, what is less known is that the liberal revolutionaries and German nationalists in Rhineland are already planning a revolt if the reforms are not restored...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
653026.A;It is in her right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG24.T;A Rhineish Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG24.D;To the surprise of absolutely no one at the Estates-General: various liberal revolutionaries, German nationalists and rogue members of both the Parti Réformiste and Democratische Partij have presented a ultimatum demanding that Burgundy immediately enacts several important political reforms or run the risk of a full scale revolt in the Rhineland. A good portion of the government somewhat agrees with the ultimatum, after all... if one does not reform the government now then it may be much more bloody in future. However, it is still a ultimatum and the Kingdom of Burgundy historically disagrees with the concept of an ultimatum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
653027.A;Denied. We don't listen to ultimatums.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
653027.B;Accepted. Nobody likes the Queen anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG25.T;The Rhineland Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG25.D;The Duchy of the Rhine is a large territorial area that has been controlled by Burgundy since the fifteenth century. The reason why this state presently exists as a autonomous entity is because whatever affection the Rhineish People had for Burgundy was effectively left null and void during the most bloody days of the Great German Wars. Burgundy continues to find a excuse to re-integrate this territory directly into Burgundy Proper again without violating international treaties. This excuse, has finally been found as Liberal revolutionaries protesting against the rolling back of political reforms have performed a coup d'état against the Rhineland Government and have declared full independence from Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG30.T;The Second Burgundian Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG30.D;The Estates-General has finally had enough. Rather then search for a successor to the Kingdom of Burgundy they have rather embarked on a ambitious plan to make several changes to the constitution of the Kingdom of Burgundy. The democratic changes to the constitution are obvious but one remaining aspect must be voted on: A Republic or A Elective Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG31.T;Communist Coup in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG31.D;A unexpected set of circumstances have occurred in $CAPITAL$ today as a large militia of communists and radical socialists have marched into the Estates-General demanding the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a socialist state built on the values of Blanquism. With the army on standby outside the capital it is likely that we should be easily able to crush them. Your Orders?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
653034.A;Crush them;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG32.D;After the conclusion of the Estates-General voted in favour of the creation of a Elective Monarchy, it had been expected that there would be a revolt of some form considering how the previous succession turned out. However, instead of a revolt there was only quiet in the Kingdom of Burgundy and everything continued on as normal. Strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG1.D;The Prince of Burgundy, Charles de Valois-Maçon has been killed in a horrible skiing accident in the Swiss Alps. As a direct result, Burgundy is left without a heir and Anne II is far beyond the age of being able to give birth. Many nations throughout Europe find our land very valuable and without a valid successor there may be be potentially serious issues in the future. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
653000.A;Oh Dear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG2.T;The Burgundian Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG2.D;Anne II has passed away and the Kingdom is left without a monarch. The Estates-General has declared that there will be a internal vote regarding various candidates brought forth by various powers in Europe and inside Burgundy Itself. Options include: The Duke of Holland (of the House of Orange-Nassau), The Count of Nevers (of the House of Valois-Nevers) or a relatively unknown Scandinavian Prince. There is potential for a deadlock in the Estates-General if the Duke of Holland is not elected but bowing to the dictates of Holland is not a very prestigious action and will likely be seen as a insult by Scandinavia and our Burgundian Population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
653001.A;For Stability: The Duke of Holland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG3.D;The Estates-General has been left at a deadlock as as the House of Orange-Nassau has ensured that our preferred king would not be elected. Our government has been rendered paralyzed and there are already rumours from the north that the Dutch are threatening to take up arms to ensure that their preferred leader will become if not king of Burgundy: The King of the Netherlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
653002.A;This is not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG4.D;There are rumours in the northern territories of a potencial revolt as the quality of life for the citizens in these regions dramatically decrease.

BRG5.T;The Dutch Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG5.D;It started with a small protest in Amsterdam against the treatment of Dutch citizens and had very quickly blown up to a full scale revolt as the entire north of Burgundy from Friesland to Anvers has broken off and declared itself free of Burgundian tyranny. Complete chaos erupts as Dutch soldiers turn on their officers and begin to attack anything that even looks like the burgundian cross. This would be bad enough, if not for the fact that all german nations and the west find themselves in a rare state of unity as they mobilize their armies and prepare for war with Burgundy to ensure that the revolt succeeds and the burgandian beast stays dead for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG13.D;The Estates-General has been left at a deadlock as as the varied dukes and counts of Burgundy would ensure that the House of Orange-Nassu would not be elected as King.

BRG14.T;The Revolt of the Dukes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BRG14.D;The various dukes and counts that make up the territories that are known as Lorraine, have decided to revolt against the Burgundian Monarchy for electing the Duke of Holland as the King of Burgundy. The Free City of Geneva has separately declared independence due to its new-found status as a exclave and general distrust of the Burgundian Monarchy. It is extremely likely that Burgundy will defeat this revolt, but there may be other geopolitical consequences to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BRG18.D;Its over. With our defeat by Lorraine the legacy created by Philip the Good is effectively dead. The Dutch King was removed from his position by his army and replaced by a Provisional Government which is already being considered a abject failure because the Dutch and Germans in Burgundy have practically already declared independence without enforcing their claim and Lorraine is already considering resurrecting the legacy of Charlemange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

However many could consider that its current state would not be possible if not for the efforts of Dimitri VI "the Great" who rebuilt the nation from its lowest point during the Great Troubles. However, there have been many questions regarding the nature of the Temryukov Dynasty, their legitimacy and the ultimate fate of the Rurikid Dynasty.

Li Xiuquing had failed in his ultimate ambition to create a Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace but had at least completely dislodged the Southern Ming dynasty from the region, the failure only coming as the remaining warlords and dynasties formed a coalition to stop the Taiping Rebellion from completely taking over the south of China. As the individuals following the Taiping religion were ultimately limited and the chances of his survival was too small, Li Xiuquing was forced to the table and forced to appoint and recognize a new dynasty in the region. The name of this dynasty would come from the strongest warlord in the region whom claimed to be of decent from a rebellious general from the previous century, Wu Sangui.

EVTNAME44187;The Taiping Anniversary;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44187;A hundred and ten years ago upon this day, the Taiping Rebellion had started. This rebellion had completely failed to created a Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace as it lacked any considerable leadership but had at least toppled the warlords in the region and forced the Southern Ming to acknowledge that they had no claim over it any more. The empire that had been created from the many compromises and deals made with the Confucian majority would be known as the Zhou Dynasty, a dynasty that was forced to acknowledge Confucian teachings but at the same time teachings of the Taiping religion. This anniversary is remarkable because the most important promise made to the Taiping leadership would be that we must embark upon a final conquest of China before this date or run the risk of another rebellion. We have grown strong in the many years since the rebellion and it seems that this would be the perfect time to launch a final conquest of china.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, one of the promises made would be that the Zhou Empire would embark on a great conquest of the rest of China before one hundred and ten years are up. It appears that the chances that the Zhou Empire will invade the rest of China are now total regardless of whomever is currently in control of the empire.

EVTNAME44163;The War of Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44163;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are crying out for the nation to once again unify. We must gather our strength and strike out at those who would divide China, leaving it weak for foreigners to prey upon. Already the banners are in the streets, and $COUNTRY$'s generals are saying now is the time to launch an offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44164;War with $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44164;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ army is massing on our mutual border, ready to make a massive offensive into $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. It seems a war is upon us, whether we like it or not: either they destroy us or we destroy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44165;Chinese Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44165;The call has come from the capital: the era of warlords is over, and all the Chinese peoples must unite under a single flag. This means $COUNTRY$ must either submit to Beijing's rule or face more war against a strong and unified foe. Your generals stand ready to receive your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44166;The Island of Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME16050214;Retreat to Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16050214;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Taiwan. The suggestion among what little remains of the Kuomintang government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taipei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.  We shall however never relinquish our rightful claim to the mainland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC44170;Either in the middle of battle or via the means of rebellion against our state, Our Great Leader has been killed.

OCC11.T;The Treaty of Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC11.D;This the end. Our government has been dissolved according to this treaty and as a result we effectively no longer exist as a state in any possible or logical way. We should have not left our capital open to attack...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC11.A;GAME OVER;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC12.T;The Two Frances;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC12.D;There are two republican Frances and they both claim to rule over France. As this situation is silly and this split is not ideological or logical in any possible way, we should consider submitting to the other France and working together to ensure a better France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

OCC12.C;THE NORTH IS CHEESE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC10.T;The Occitan Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC10.D;Occitania has betrayed the idea of sister republics and instead seeks to unite france under the valois dynasty. As the vanguard of republicanism in western europe upon the death of the Dual Monarchy, we are forced to take a stand and counter their absurd claims followed by placing their territory under our domain rather then theirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

OCC1.T;The Direction of Occitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

OCC2.T;The Final Stage of the Hundred Year War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

65101.B;;You know. A new latin empire sounds good about now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC3.T;Becoming Provence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC3.D;Occitania does not have a strong enough claim on france itself. To show the north that we are legitmate about destroying their authority, we must become Provence and crown a king which is related to the Valois.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

OCC4.T;The Occitania-Catalonia Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The Government of Occitania has already sent a letter to the government of Catalonia regarding immediate unification as per written in the constitution of Occitania and is expecting a positive responce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65103.A;We shall greet our new brothers in arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC5.T;Occitania has asked for immediate unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

OCC8.T;Portugese Unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC8.D;With our conquest of Iberia complete, we have found ourselves unable to correctly administrate all the land that we have conquered. As such our most remote piece of iberian territory, Portugal has erupted into major unrest and has effectively declared itself outside of our prestgious rule. With further unrest thoughout the other conquered territories we must come to a compromise that will benefit all our new subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
65107.A;If we must.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC9.T;The Portugal Compromise ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
OCC9.D;After weeks of deliberation and discussion, it has been concluded that the only valid course of action to appease our iberian citizens is to create a independent portuguese state. With such a small loss of land we will be among the most stable empires in europe and may even be able to consider ourselves on the same level as some of the larger empires in europe. However, it is still a loss of land and many inside Occitania disagree that we should even give any land away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

However, the far majority in our government consider such a proposition foolish and it is unlikely that such ideas could prosper under a democratic government.

### The Great Northern Brothers War ####;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME191913;Imperial Alliance has Collapsed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC191913;The glorious alliance between Burgundy and Scandinavia has finally collapsed today after years of decline. This alliance was first created to fight the German revolutionaries and then expanded to fight Bohemian expansion but various colonial tensions between Scandinavia and Burgundy have made it impossible to maintain. As a result we have nothing protecting us from Bohemian expansion into Pommerania and it is extremely likely that if Bohemia declared war on us at this time we would lose badly. So, we can choose to either keep the land directly and fight the inevitable war with Bohemia or appease Bohemia by creating a German vassal state which we will keep until such time that further expansion by Bohemia is rendered impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA191913;Create the Vassal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB191913;We can survive Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME191914;The threat has passed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC191914;As Europe collapses into endless liberal revolutions, Bohemia has been weakened to the point where it is impossible for them to continue to pursue their objective of recreating the Holy Roman Empire. It should now be possible to re-integrate Pommerania and resume the construction of a Scandinavian Empire which stretches around the whole of the Baltic Sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA191914;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME191901;The Decline of Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC191901;We have utterly failed to secure Scandinavian domination of the Baltic Sea and North Sea and our national prestige has been utterly decimated. It seems that as it stands it is extremely unlikely we will recover from this sorry state and many of our citizens have already erupted into revolt over the idea of a world without a strong Scandinavian Power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA191901;Oh No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME191902;The Return of Sweden;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC191902;A new movement has been created in the old Swedish part of our state. An idea that the Scandinavian Government in its Baltic, British and German ambitions had effectively abandoned the importance of Scandinavia itself and rather then attempt to solve the potential disunity in the state when times had become tough it had continued to peruse its various ambitions regardless of the consequences. Riots have already erupted in various cities that are not directly Scandinavian land and things may soon devolve into a bloodbath not seen in the history of this country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA191902;We are all Scandinavian, right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME191903;The Second Livonian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC191903;In a bold speech at the palace of Riga, the Governor of Livonia has declared independence from Scandinavian tyranny and has already mobilized a army to enforce this claim. As the war rages on in Sweden we have been unable to effectively manage our external territories and there nothing that we are able to do to stop the Governor from starting yet another war. It appears that a second Livonian war is now upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA191903;The vultures circle us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME191904;The Great Northern Brothers War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC191904;In what many European commentators would call a impossibility beyond the imagination of even the most insane political theorists. The entire state of Scandinavia has imploded into two rival factions which have differing opinions on the purpose and identity of the Scandinavian nation. One of these factions seeks the death of the current union, the other seeks to continue the union as it currently is. Regardless, whomever wins will dictate the fate of Scandinavia regardless of the casualties. The snow shall be stained red.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME191908;The End of Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC191908;The old Scandinavia is a dead idea. Burned away by the Swedish who would prefer a state which is for Scandinavians and only Scandinavians. The treaty which they have presented us limits our territory to Denmark and Norway and we must comply because we have been left with no choice due to the catastropic territory loss of Sweden itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA191908;Fools, The Germans are going to be in Copenhagen by the end of next year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME191909;Livonia has been defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC191909;We have defeated Livonia and have already executed the Governor for his treason. It is likely that Livonia will remain a core territory of Scandinavia for the rest of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAGGIS01.T;The Scottish Aristocratic Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS01.D;Scandinavia has held Scotland ever since the Stewart Dynasty had risen to the throne of a recently unified Scandinavia, but it had never truly tamed the country. Scotland was always the country of the Scottish and each and everyone one of them would quite clearly claim that the current situation regarding their territory being a part of Scandinavia was only a temporary fact, rather then a permanent one. The most notable of these "rebellious" types are the aristocratic families of Scotland who have despised Scandinavia since the day that Scotland had joined it. Today, a society of aristocrats have met in Glasgow to formulate a plan to ensure Scottish independence in the near future and they are already considering bringing it up with the regional government in the near future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS01.A;The Scottish are always causing trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS02.T;The Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS02.D;The Scottish Regional Government disobeying direct orders from Copenhagen has decided to hear out the Aristocratic Society. A petition date has already been organized and the Scandinavian Government is already waiting for the results of these futile arguments regarding how the Scandinavian Government has failed in their duty to protect the Scottish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS02.A;A joke. Nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS03.T;The Scottish Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS03.D;The Scottish Aristocratic Society has been agitating for a independent Scotland for hundreds of years and today they finally make their move. They have appeared in front of a special session of the Scottish Government to justify their claims that Scandinavian Government is no longer able to protect the Scottish people and that Scotland should declare independence. Indeed, if Scandinavia has failed in their role as the protector of the north then it is likely that their claims will hold true. However, if Scandinavia has maintained stability and the British islands are still under the domain of a French-aligned Anglois empire then it is likely that this petition will fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS03.A;They better understand that treason is unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS04.T;Scandinavian Decline;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS04.D;The Society has presented the argument that since Scandinavia is no longer considered a great power of Europe. That it does not have the ability to protect the Scottish people against the legitimate great powers of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS04.A;A regrettable situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS05.T;Stewarts Deposed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS05.D;A good reason why Scotland has not detached from Scandinavia on a earlier basis is because they had a sense of national pride regarding the Stewart Dynasty. Since they are now effectively being ruled by Scandinavians and not the Scottish, the Aristocratic Society has already gathered members of the Stewart Dynasty to resume their rule over Scotland if independence occurs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS05.A;The Republic is the only way forwards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS06.T;Failed Protectors - Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS06.D;Among the list of various failures that the Scandinavian Government has "achieved" was the loss of North Germany. Indeed, how could they protect Scotland from whomever controls England if they cannot protect Germany?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS06.A;Add that to the list.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS07.T;Failed Protectors - Livonia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS07.D;Livonia had been controlled by Scandinavia since the days of yore and yet now it has failed to hold on to it? Unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS07.A;That's quite enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS08.T;The Dictatorship;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS08.D;The $MONARCHTITLE$ is not born of the Stewarts and yet he controls tyrannical powers far beyond what the Stewarts had ever achieved. The Regional Government feels threatened just by even holding this petition and is likely to listen to whatever false words come out of this "Conspiracy" and agree with them on everything. They have already committed treason by doing so, might as well just get the rebellion over and done with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS08.A;The Secret Police have failed this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS09.T;England Prevails!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAGGIS09.D;England exists, and so does its efforts to destabilise Scandinavia in the British isles.

This very society that had claimed that we had failed to protect the Scottish would not last for more then a week after the petition failed as its leadership was arrested for treason against the Scandinavian nation when they attempted (and failed) to coup the very government that had denied them their claims. Furthermore, this event has further legitimised our claim over the Celtic and Northern Parts of the British Islands and we should be able to claim such lands if the right circumstances were to occur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW01.T;The Two Capitals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW01.D;Ever since the creation of Spain in the 16th Century, there has been a constant debate regarding which capital the Kingdom should be ruled from. For a short period at the beginning of the 19th Century, the capital was moved to Lisbon for the very first time under the initiative of Jose "the Reformer". However, his successor Pedro IV would opt to move the capital back to Madrid as the Viceroyalities started to collapse into rebellion. Now as the fires of rebellion have finally died down in Columbia either though our ultimate victory or defeat, Alfonso XV has finally decided to put a end to this debate and choose the true capital of Spain once and for all. The institutions of Spain shall be forever be tied to this permanent capital and it shall be never moved again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW02.D;$COUNTRY$ has suffered endless setbacks in foreign policy, economic decision making and military mobilization. The result is that Spain, once one of the greatest nations in the world: has been rendered irrelevant. Countless citizens have taken to the streets to protest our persevered weakness and there are already talks of succession or revolution by independence movements or military cliques. It is only a matter of time before a match is struck and $COUNTRY$ burns to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW17.T;The Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW17.D;The crisis has hit a new level today as the King has dissolved parliament and taken effective control over the entire apparatus of state with the justification being of emergency circumstances. However, this did not go down well with the population of $COUNTRY$ who have seen fit to permanently cut off communication with the central government and leave the situation in a stand off between the government and these various movements.

SPACW03.T;The Federal Review;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW03.D;The Lisbon-ruled Spanish Federation has found itself confused by various reports that state that various city governments in Castille are simply refusing to pay tax with the reason that the federation does not have any right to rule over Castille as the union of crowns that permitted such a aberration has been deposed. A review board has been created and a census is under way to find out exactly causing grief with these local governments beyond that of simple monarchist ties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW03.A;The monarchy is dead. They need to get over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW04.T;The Review Fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW04.D;The Spanish Federation is unable to formulate any policy that could solve these innate issues with the population because as it turns out a clique of military officers have already taken the initiative and have seized Madrid. They are now claiming to be the legitimate government of Spain but have taken no moves to ignite a civil war in the hopes that we will stand down and let them take over the country. This is a stand off. Civil War is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW04.A;This is madness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW05.T;Military Movements in Madrid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW05.D;One of our most esteemed Generals, one "General Zavala" has seen fit to relocate a large portion of veterans of the Guardia Real to Madrid. Zavala has continued to claim that our republican revolution was a Portuguese conspiracy and that they always felt that the monarchy should be abolished and the capital moved to Lisbon after the betrayal of Alfonso XV in his choice to keep the capital in Madrid. It is likely that he is of very little threat to us because if he attempts to coup the government, the citizens will just counter him with force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW06.T;Zavala's Coup d'etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPACW06.D;What the government of Spain was somewhat expecting has finally occurred: General Zavala has assumed the apparatus of government in Madrid today by force of arms. The parliament has been dissolved and Zavala is already claiming that the Portuguese traitors shall be dealt with and anyone supporting the ideas of democracy will be suppressed. Naturally, in Portugal and Galicia this has been taken as a insult but the greatest threat lies in the monarchist circles in Castille whom were expecting a immediate restoration after the coup but were denied as Zavala would prefer to remain president-for-life. For a moment, Spain is quiet. However, this stand off cannot last forever. Civil War is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACW10.D;The nightmare that everyone had expected has finally occurred. A individual claiming to be a member of the long lost original House of Aviz has persuaded a good portion of Castille to break off and declare independence with the expectation of creating a democratic Kingdom of Castille. Only in the chaos of a civil war could have anyone expected such a situation to occur but the seeds were planted back when the capital had been chosen and a good portion of the Castillian population had decided that independence would be preferable to being ruled by Portugal. This threat must be defeated or it will be the death of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DUA70.D;With the Anglois Question now out into the open and slowly tearing the country to pieces, Henri X has deemed it necessary that the Estates-General must be dissolved at once to ensure future stablity of the state. There are many questions to why he would do such a thing but it is likely that though his experiences of the German Revolution and various other events in recent years, he has come to believe that democracy in any regard is a destabilizing force and no state can survive without it being abolished. However, a few in the Dual Monarchy feel that his experiences should rather reaffirm the Estates-General and not be cause to dismantle it. Regardless of the outcome it is likely that his event shall affect the coming importance of the Anglois Question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

DUA71.T;The Paris Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA71.D;Dissolving the Estates-General was going to have consequences and so Paris is in complete revolt. The King of the Dual-Monarchy has been presented with two possible ways to resolve this situation, he can either give in and restore the Estates-General to what is was before the Counter-Revolution or alternatively he can use the few remaining military assets scattered outside of Paris to attack and destroy the revolt. However due to the saturation of this revolt and the fact that these military assets are mostly left over artillery from the German Revolution, it is likely that this will be considered a not very prestigious act and ultimately one of sheer desperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The order given to fire the artillery at Paris had catastrophic consequences as a few shells landed in the occupied Paris Arsenal and destroyed a large chunk of the city in a catastrophic explosion. Already the nationalists and liberals are claiming martyrs and whatever chances we had of resolving the Anglois Question without major revolts is effectively dead. It is already expected that we will have very dangerous nationalist and liberal activity in the near future and it may even result in the collapse of this nation to these revolts. We must prepare ourselves. The tide is coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DUA175.T;The Great Gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA175.D;As the tide of liberal revolution burns throughout Europe, it has rendered the Dual Monarchy in an extremely unstable position and the Anglois Question is likely to be the doom of us unless we promptly crack down heavily on one of the groups that are leading this revolt against the Anglois Nation. Two potential options have been presented to the Estates-General regarding resolving the current crisis, one that deliberately targets separatist groups aligned with the Anglican English and another that deliberately targets separatist groups aligned with the Protestant Occitan. Whomever we target is likely to be secured without much of a issue but the other group is likely to react against this decision to such a degree that our ability to control the region will be sacrificed, for now. Of course we could refuse to enact either option and sacrifice nothing but the Anglois question will continue to destabilize our nation and make the general integration of our non-Anglois population an extremely difficult endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Unsurprisingly, this has been met with a uproar from Occitania which has found themselves under endless oppression since the liberal revolutions of the 1840s. A group known as the Sons of Saint Louis have declared what is now called "The Third Aquitaine Revolt" as they illegally seize a large portion of Occitania to "protect themselves from the Anglois menace who seek to destroy their culture". Unfortunately for them, this revolt has little or no international recognition and it is unlikely that it will seen as anything more then a minor police action by the great powers of Europe.

They say that this was a result of the former policies of the Dual Monarchy that had deliberately targeted and oppressed the English Population and left the Occitan regions feeling as if they would be the next to have their cultures effectively destroyed and forcefully integrated into the Anglois Culture. This had left the regions in a state of effective anarchy with minimal control being felt from Paris and many independence groups popping up that would deliberately target any attempts for the Anglois Culture to spread to these regions.

The absolute majority of the government is ready to pass this legislation but there is still a exceptionally small minority that is willing to support the schooling reforms, the head of state could easily intervene to support their position with the point that attempting to create such a state entirely goes against the point of the $COUNTRY$.

persian_unification_iraqwest_title;The Unification of Persia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
persian_unification_iraqwest_desc;The Kingdom of Iraq has decided upon its direction and it is towards the Levant. Our territories are no longer under threat of conquest by Iraq and with the decline of the Ottoman Empire there has been opening in our ability to finally unify Persia after three hundred years. May the most legendary dynasty win!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

persian_unification_civilization_desc;Civilization has finally reached Persia and this current circumstance of rival dynasties no longer suits what could be called a civilized and modern state. We must end this three hundred year long war between brothers and reunify Persia once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
duranni_empire_title;Establish the Durrani Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
duranni_empire_desc;The Afsharid Dynasty may have completely failed its efforts in uniting Persia during the 18th Century but its legacy had ultimately lived on in the Sadozai Kingdom which has done what the Afsharid had never achieved and successfully conquered Persia. It is now time to claim the prestigious title of Shahanshah, the King of Kings and unite Persia under the Durrani!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
duranni_empire_capital_title;The Afsharid Capital;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
duranni_empire_capital_desc;It was said that once the Afsharid Dynasty had successfully united Persia, the capital would be moved to Mashhad due to it being in a far more effective position to rule over both Afganistan and Persia. The Durrani Empire should follow in their footsteps and move the capital to this very city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PER4.T;The End of the Afsharid Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PER4.D;The Kingdom of Afganistan was once a minor title under that of the Afsharid Dynasty, but as the Afsharid Dynasty had failed in its attempt to unify Persia under its rule. So did the ability for it to continue to rule over Afghanistan and rather a minor tribal leader outside of Kabul would be named its King instead of the Afsharids. This king would go on to perform the impossible task of liberating a good portion of the Sikhs from the rule of the Mughal Empire but ultimately fail to perform any further conquest due to a entire generation being effectively killed in the bloodbath required to achieve such a feat. Two more kings have past and now with information from the west signalling the end of the Ottoman Civil War and either its collapse or decline, it is time to finally begin our duty of conquering the west by starting with the nation where our Kingdom had been established from: The Afsharid Dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PER4.A;This is the end of the Afsharid Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PER5.T;Intervention in Persia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PER5.D;We have a opportunity to finally destroy the Persian Dynastic States once and for all as they have decided to take up arms against one another and allow our easy intervention in this conflict to take out both at the same time. It is likely that this conflict will be long and bloody and perhaps even cause conflict with our Sikh holdings but this is a opportunity that we cannot ignore because we will quite simply never have one again, this is our last chance to take Persia for ourselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

333504.T;The Belgian Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333504.D;The Belgian Confederacy has far exceeded the other states in Eastern Arcadia as a power and will likely unify the entire region under its will alone. We may despise the rulers of Plantagenia but if we do nothing it is likely that both of us shall fall to the Belgian threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333504.A;We have no choice but to seek a alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

333505.T;Vinland's Request;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333505.D;Vinland is requesting a conference regarding solving territorial disputes and forming a alliance to fight the Belgian Threat. If we do not ally Vinland it is likely that we will be swept away by the Belgian Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333505.A;We agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333505.B;We shall never make a deal with Vinland. Plantagenia forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333506.T;The Arcadia Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333506.D;With the Belgian Confederacy becoming a major threat to both Plantagenia and Vinland interests, they have decided to call a conference and come to an agreement regarding territorial disputes. The primary goal of the conference being that they form an alliance to combat the Belgian threat. Already the conference has started on the matter of territorial disputes and will come to a conclusion shortly regarding needed transfers of land or the removal of claims on such land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333506.A;We never wanted to do this but we have no choice. The Confederacy must die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333507.T;Plantagenia Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333507.D;After much deliberation and countless arguments. The conference has ruled in favor of Plantagenia regarding the disputed territories.

333509.T;Death of the Arcadian Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333509.D;With the death of democracy in Arcadia, the Pan-Arcadian Dream is effectively undone. As the foundations of democracy, freedom and the rule of law are eroded by institutions believing that Arcadia cannot be a nation of individual rule, the treaties created as a part of the Arcadian Conferences have been rendered moot. As a result, there are already concerns that the territories that gave up their autonomy to create a unitary Arcadia are considering succession...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333509.A;The traitors shall be dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

333524.D;A Claim has been made by either the Confederacy or us that goes against the concept of a separate Vinlandic State. As such, these claims have been automatically redacted for the convenience of both parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333524.A;How strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,we still have one card left in our desk and it involves the fact that unlike Plantagenia, we are of a culture that is utterly unrelated to the Confederacy and can sacrifice our ability to form an Arcadian Union on the alter of maintaining our independence. A simple proclamation that we prioritise the Vinlandic identity and it should render it effectively impossible for the the Belgian Confederacy to conquer us..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333525.A;The Arcadian Banner shall not fly over our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333525.B;We shall strive towards a Arcaidan Union still.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333526.T;Vinland denies the Arcadian Dream!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333525.T;The Vinlandic Evacuation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333525.D;We have lost all our disputed territories to the Belgian Confederacy and have been rendered utterly irrelevant in Arcadia. However, 
333526.D;Vinland has proclaimed that is no longer has any intent to peruse the Arcadian dream and has proclaimed its full independence from anyone attempting to do so. Unfortunately, we must acknowledge this claim under international law and until such time that our government has no intent on following international law: they will not be joining any potential Arcadian union. We could hand them back their historical cultural land in return for them permanently revoking their claims over Septiman territory as well, or we could just permit them to keep their claims and give them nothing. .;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333526.A;Hand it back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333526.B;Dammit! Vinlandic Traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333527.T;Vinlandic Territory Returned;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333527.D;The Confederacy is offering all territories of Vinlandic Culture in return for a permanent revocation of all claims we have over Septiman Territory. It would be rather idiotic not to take this offer as this practically guarantees us free territory, but the revocation of our claims also prevents future expansion into the Confederacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333527.A;Sure;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
333527.B;We will get back our claims!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

##### Mughal Collapse #####;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND01.T;The Lost Province;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND01.D;The Mughal Empire had been left in a period of instability many decades ago and as a result the Nazims of Bengal had declared their independence. We have been avoiding a confrontation with the east for many years because of the potentially destabilizing effect it could have on our Hindu subjects but now it seems that the situation has changed. There has been a incident on the border between our men and theirs and many inside the Durbar are already calling for blood. At this point it seems that war is inevitable and utterly unavoidable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND01.A;Into the tempest we go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND02.T;Bengal is Gone;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND02.D;At some point in the past decade, Bengal had fallen into the hands of a foreign power. Already our inability to regain the rogue province has created a destabilizing effect in our empire and it is likely that worse is to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND02.A;Into the tempest we go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND03.T;The Mughals have returned;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND03.D;The Mughal Empire has declared that they would finally regain their lost territory from us. The idea of neutrality that the Sultan has been perusing no longer suits us any more, it is time for us to re-militarise and put all our effort into fighting this extreme threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND03.A;We were preparing for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND04.T;The Durbar was wrong;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND04.D;The decision that was forced upon us by the Mughal Durbar did exactly as we had expected. There has been a rather sudden decline in the stability of our nation and it seems that revolt is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND04.A;The Court is almost never wrong. Expect when it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND05.T;Chaos in the Mughal Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND05.D;As we had expected, it seems that a state of total chaos has erupted throughout the Mughal Empire as various minority groups attack each other relentlessly. The Hindus fight the Muslims and the various nazims throughout our empire are already considering declaring independence from our rapidly collapsing empire. We are in a very dire state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND05.A;We should have just forgotten about Bengal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND06.T;The Mughal Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND06.D;The Mughal Empire has been in various states of the decline for the past century and a half but the greatest loss was that of the critically important lands of Bengal. Any attempt to regain Bengal would have had serious consequences and as the Mughal Empire finally went on a campaign to reclaim its lost lands, nationalist and religious tensions would cause the country to collapse into a bloodbath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND06.A;I hope the Europeans are not watching.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND07.T;The Mughals have surrendered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND07.D;The Mughals have permitted us to have our independence and they shall not return to our territory (for now).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND07.A;We win. They lose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND23.T;The Sultanate of Bengal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND23.D;The Sultanate of Bengal was created when the Nazims of Bengal declared independence during a economic crisis and instability in the Mughal Empire. Bengal would prosper for a time after that but soon run into tensions when both Muslim and Hindu groups started relentlessly attacking each other over what they both considered their rightful territory, the Sultan would put a stop to this by doing the unthinkable: political neutrality. If the Sultan of Bengal would promise not to attempt to conquer more Hindu subjects then the Islamic population would never find themselves outnumbered, the Islamic subjects of Bengal were appeased with this and the Hindu subjects would tolerate it. However the fact that Bengal cannot peruse military conquest for now is crippling. It seems that it would take a crisis of some form to break this unfortunate situation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND23.A;A shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
##### Hindustan Conference #####;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
centralize_dravida_title;Centralize Dravida;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
centralize_dravida_desc;With our total control over the far south of India, we must centralize our colonial administration in Dravida to permit additional efficiency in our exploitation of Indian resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND08.T;The $CAPITAL$ Conference of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND08.D;The colonial powers of the world have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the civil war in the Mughal Empire. The outcome of this conference has become known as the 'The Hindustan Act of the $CAPITAL$ Conference', officially abolishing any previous treaties regarding this region and formalizing the exploitation and annexation of Indian nations. After this point, any aggressive action in India will be justified which includes annexation though spheres of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND09.T;Imperialism Comes to $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND09.D;European presence in $COUNTRY$ is felt everywhere. Their traders come to $CAPITAL$ and dictate to our own merchants how trade will commence. They take what they want and pay what they wish. They tell our government what laws we may pass, and even when they do not we must always consider how they will react to what we do. If $COUNTRY$ does not act now, they will turn our nation into a colony under our very noses-- but perhaps that has already happened, and we must resign ourselves to their protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND10.T;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND10.D;Our presence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached the point where $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence is felt in every level of their society. They are a protectorate in all but name, and the time has come for us to determine whether that status should be made official. Shall we agree to make $FROMCOUNTRY$ a protectorate and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony, or support their independence as a friendly ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND11.T;Nationals Expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND11.D;A disturbing report has reached us of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals being expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Indeed, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has systematically eliminated our influence-- meaning we are in a position where we must either accept the humiliation of being thrown out of an uncivilized country or step in and assert our authority. There are some who say this is a golden opportunity to establish a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ protectorate, while others say $FROMCOUNTRY$ is simply not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND11.A;How unwise of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HND11.B;We will not force ourselves upon $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HND12.T;The Spices of Mysore;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND12.D;Our control over Ceylon is not enough to ensure that we have reasonable control over the indian spice trade. We shall puppet the state of Mysore and ensure that the spice does indeed. FLOW.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND12.A;The Spice shall flow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND12.B;Spice is horrible. Get it away from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND13.T;The Question of Bengal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND13.D;Bengal is a territory in the north-east of Hindustan that has always remained expectionally valuable to any nation that has held it. Unfortunantly, Bengal is now considering itself a self-standing independent nation and that is wasting valuable resources that could be used in the hands of Europeans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Mughal_Victory_desc;We have taken back all the territory that we had lost during the civil war. With a greater understanding regarding social structures we are able to accept the minority cultures that once accepted us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND14.T;Trade Company Manipulation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND14.D;Ever since the conclusion of the Hindustan Conference, the western corporations and businesses in $COUNTRY$ have done all they can to take over every layer of our government. As we had taken the path of opening up to western nations we have very little or no choice in the matter of being able to avoid their influence. Soon we may even lose our independence to the very nations that once told us that it was our goal to westernise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND15.T;Indian Sphere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND15.D;Our businesses have effectively taken full control over a Indian country and it has now fallen into our sphere. Already government planners are preparing plans for annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND16.T;The Gateway to India;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND16.D;We own Rangoon but the rest of Burma currently sits outside of our colonial territories. We should consider the conquest of the rest of Burma to give us a gateway into Hindustan and the Bengalese Trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND17.T;The Auspicious Meeting - Maharashtra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND17.D;A prince from Maharashtra has come to us seeking audience. He is aware of the Hindustan Conference and intends to kneel to $COUNTRY$ so long as he is permitted limited autonomy and the ability to rule over his own country. He will also permit any coastal concessions that we demand and he will give us access to the full economy of his wealthy lands. The creation of this princely state is likely to be far more profitable then just taking the lands that we need as we will have full cooperation of its leadership, rather then another highly hostile colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND18.T;Maharashtra Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND18.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has permitted one of our northern princes to kneel to $FROMCOUNTRY$ at the same time as demanding various territorial concessions, before any of our relatively outdated military assets had a chance to stop him from doing so. The territory had already been garrisoned by $FROMCOUNTRY$ and since have very little chance in fighting modern European military assets, we must relent or give them a excuse to entirely integrate us into their growing empire regardless of our present westernisation progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND19.T;The Auspicious Meeting - Hyderabad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND19.D;A prince from Hyderabad has come to us seeking audience. He is aware of the Hindustan Conference and intends to kneel to $COUNTRY$ so long as he is permitted limited autonomy and the ability to rule over his own country. He will also permit any coastal concessions that we demand and he will give us access to the full economy of his wealthy lands. The creation of this princely state is likely to be far more profitable then just taking the lands that we need as we will have full cooperation of its leadership, rather then another highly hostile colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND20.T;Hyderabad Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND20.D;One of our princes have effectively signed away our full independence in the vain hope that this will prevent our annexation by $FROMCOUNTRY$. He would be correct of course, this concession will prevent our ultimate destruction by $FROMCOUNTRY$. But at what cost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND21.T;The Auspicious Meeting - Gwalior;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND21.D;A prince from Gwalior has come to us seeking audience. He is aware of the Hindustan Conference and intends to kneel to $COUNTRY$ so long as he is permitted limited autonomy and the ability to rule over his own country. However, unlike other concessions this one is unlikely to give us anything apart from a vassal which will of course be useful in blocking other European nations from expanding beyond the centre of India but economically worthless. Should we give this prince the autonomy he needs, or will we just continue our intent to annex his nation. Remember, if we refuse this offer he may take this to another nation and they will put this territory under their control rather then us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND22.T;Gwalior Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND22.D;One of our princes have effectively signed away our full independence in the vain hope that this will prevent our annexation by $FROMCOUNTRY$. He would be correct of course, this concession will prevent our ultimate destruction by $FROMCOUNTRY$. But at what cost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND29.T;Conquest of Punjab;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HND29.D;The Governor of Pakistan has requested that we intervene in the newly independent state of Punjab to secure our interests in this region. Since Punjab is likely to become a detriment to our interests in the region due to its high population and claims over Delhi, it would be well advised to listen to the Governor of Pakistan in this matter and establish a protectorate over the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HND24.D;With the acceptance of semi-autonomous princely states in Central India and the growing trend of European interests in the region. Various willing Indian princes have met in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the creation of a organization that will provide for collaborator princes in central India. The organization that they created would be known as the: "Confederate Institution for Indian Civilization" or what is just known as the "Princely Confederation" for short. This organization presently claims most of Central India as a neutral or "princely" zone but if any European nation were to organize colonies that directly conflict with these claims then they would have to accept such reorganizations. This organization after all is not a nation state, yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

organize_australia_title;Organize Terra Australis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
organize_australia_desc;We should organize the Australian colonies to better reflect both a local structure, as well as set up the possibility for autonomous rule-- dominated by our benevolent colonial administrators, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

reorganize_australia_desc;Now that we have taken possession of the Australian colony, we should reorganize its structure to make it truly part of our greater colonial administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_of_zuharra_title;Conquest of Eastern Terra Australis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
conquest_of_zuharra_desc;The Colony of Terra Australis has been created but lacks the far more wealthy east- which is controlled by the notorious Chinese colonial nation known as Zhouaro. As this nation has failed to prove itself as any more then a petty kingdom and a laughing stock of the whole world- we must immediately invade it and install our own benevolent government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO1.T;The Conquest of Terra Australis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO1.D;Terra Australis still evades Europa, as the saying goes. We now understand the existence of the Chinese colonial state of Zhourao which occupies the east coast of Terra Australis but it is obvious that the west remains absolutely empty. Should we send a colonial expedition to this side of the continent with the hope that we may find something useful?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO2.T;We have found nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO2.D;Our explorers have completely failed in finding anything that resembles fertile land in the western part of Terra Australis. We will have to call off our expedition and hope that nobody else finds anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO3.T;Colonization is possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO3.D;Our expedition has found fertile land in the southernmost part of the southern continent. This has evaded both European and Chinese explorers for centuries but it is clear that with our modern technology it has become possible to navigate the continent in a way that has allowed this discovery to be made. All that's left to do now is send the colonial fleet and this territory shall be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO4.T;The Europeans have arrived;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO4.D;There has already been word of a colonial fleet arriving on the westernmost part of the continent which contains thousands of Europeans that are clearly ready to take over the whole continent- just as they did what is now known as Arcadia. They have already declared that this continent be named "Terra Australis" and not Zuharra! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO5.T;The Last Bastion of Humanity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO5.D;There is one remaining place that eludes Europa, and that is the island that is to the east of Zhourao that is without a name to speak of. The various Burgundian and Dutch traders from Indonesia have called it: "New Zealand" but have not taken any effort to colonize the island due to fears of the natives that occupy it. As the main continent has been effectively occupied by another colonial power in the west, this remains the sole remaining place in this part of the world that we should be able to colonize. Shall we do so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO6.T;The Death of Zhourao;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZHO6.D;We have been given a ultimatum from the colonial overlord of Terra Australis that it is time for the nation of Zhourao to cease existing and that total occupation from Terra Australis must occur. We may have a technological advantage here, but it is unlikely that we will be able to beat the combined armies of the colonial empire. Should we fight as honour demands us to do so, or surrender in the hopes that Zhourao will rise another day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

INDO1.T;The Second Khmer Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO1.D;Udaraja III has reigned for ten years in the Khmer Empire and yet he only sees a tiny Kingdom in place of what was once a great empire! Alas, the failures of the glorious Khmer Empire during the 18th Century had resulted in a catastrophic period of troubles that lasted for twenty seven years between 1749 and 1776 and had tore the second empire to pieces. With the empire effectively crippled and in a state that has not been seen since the bleak days of the Khemer Dark Ages (after the Collapse of the First Empire). One would think that it was unable to rise again. However rumours are spreading that the King of Champa is suffering from a terrible disease...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO1.A;For Angkor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO2.T;The Kingdom of Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO2.D;The Kingdom of Champa has maintained its independence from both Dai Vet and the Second Khmer Empire for over eighty years now, but the dynasty of Champa is currently weak. As it turns out, the current king of Champa is suffering from a terrible disease with no known cure and the only heir is two years old. Already vultures are circling the throne and waiting for his inevitable death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO2.A;The nation is doomed! (GAME OVER IS LIKELY);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO3.T;The Collapse of Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO3.D;The King of Champa has been suffering from a terrible illness for months and today he has finally passed away. The only heir was a two year old whom displeased the military enough to result in them immediately declaring the abolition of the monarchy with the insane excuse that Asia needed to move into a age of modernity away from monarchies, even as they seize power themselves and proclaim a dictatorship. This intolerable fact has resulted in the region of Champa breaking away and joining the Empire of Dai Nam and the rest being left as prey to a Khmer Empire that is expecting its restoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO3.A;The President will save us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO4.T;The Succession of the Region of Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO4.D;The Region of Champa has declared succession from the collapsing Champa and has deliberately joined Dai Vet on a permanent basis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO4.A;That was easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO5.T;The Death of Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO5.D;Uaraja III has declared that the Republic of Champa shall be dissolved and annexed into the Khmer Empire directly. All young men must join up in this mission to scare away European ideas and "liberalism" from Asia! Indeed, this should be the first step in the restoration of the Second Khmer Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO5.A;Hurrah!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO6.T;Missionaries in Cochinchina;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO6.D;The collapse of Champa was likely to have consequences. The most obvious was that of it being considered prime territory for European missionaries seeking to convert individuals to their belief systems. The greatest concentration of these missionaries are in the ports of Cochinchina and it is likely that there could be major issues in the future if any European power takes direct interest in this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
INDO6.A;Hopefully nobody notices..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO7.T;A strange request from Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO7.D;Some of our missionaries in Cochinchina have had enough of the persecution of their missions and have requested that we directly intervene. They have asked us to request the local government in the Cochinchina region to seek protectorate status away from whatever indochinese empire is oppressing them. It is likely that we should be able to easily acquire that territory without any need for a colonial war in the region, but there is a chance that the empire owning that territory will not be pleased and start a war anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
INDO8.T;Cochinchina Seized by $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO8.D;The local government in Cochinchina has requested protectorate status from $FROMCOUNTRY$ and has been officially granted it. As a result the entire region has broken off from our empire and $FROMCOUNTRY$ states that if we take any effort to recover the territory then we will have to fight them for it. As $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a European country, this war may be considered suicidal by nature and it is likely that if we attempted to fight them then we would lose. However, losing territory and not doing anything about it is considered extremely non-prestigious and will harm our empire in more ways then just territorial loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO8.A;We will attempt to fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO8.B;Let them have it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO9.T;The Return to Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO9.D;The Hindustan Conference had only demonstrated that India needed civilization to effectively resemble modernity. However, to the east of India is the region of Indochina which has been known to be far more bloody and self-destructive then India in even its worst periods of history. $COUNTRY$ should attempt to provide Indochina with the same level of civilization as afforded to the Indians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO9.A;Onto Civilization!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ wants Champa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has demanded that we cede the Region of Champa to them on the basis that we have no right to occupy a territory that was rightfully part of the Kingdom of Champa. As $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a European nation, attempting to refuse would result in a deadly war that we would be unlikely to win. However allowing further territory in Indochina to be taken by a European nation would be a exceptionally bad idea if one wanted to maintain independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.A;We cannot fight them! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO10.B;Not one more province. Fight them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
INDO11.T;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO11.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to us demanding that we sign their so called: "Treaty to maintain stability and civilized society in Indochina". This treaty effectively partitions our nation and allows $FROMCOUNTRY$ full control over our economy and foreign policy. Signing this treaty would be a death sentence. Fighting back would also likely be a death sentence. Die or die gloriously, these are our only choices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO11.A;Capitulate (GAME OVER);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO11.B;Its time for a last stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INDO13.T;The Indochina Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INDO13.D;$COUNTRY$ has been pressuring Dai Nam into signing a unequal treaty designed to stabilize the region with the expectation of foreign investment. However, this treaty is extremely unequal and is designed to partition and weaken Indochina to the point where it would be easily possible for the complete subjugation of the region to European interests. Unfortunately Dai Nam has been forced to sign this unequal treaty, either though capitulation on the matter or having it enforced after a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Gabor I was not a ambitious man and never had any children or close relatives to speak of, the Duchy of Nitria after all was not a prestigious title. This has caused succession issues that will have to be solved with a Regency Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

HUN17.T;Springtime in Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN17.D;The Hungarian regency council has been unable to select a replacement king after the death of Gabor I and have practically resorted to bickering between each other for little or no reason. The liberal revolutions that have spread throughout Europe have taken a interest in this predicament and have promptly declared the Kingdom of Hungary effectively dead as they have committed to a coup d'etat that has taken out both the regency council and the entire "reactionary" government with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
265417.A;For the revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN18.T;A Alternative Option;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN18.D;Rather then search for a hard-to-find survivor of a long-dead Hungarian dynasty or risk further falling into Bohemian influence by crowning a member of the Jagellion Dynasty, we could crown the Duke of Austria as the King of Hungary and create a union between us and them. Its a controversial option and has a lot of opposition but the potential of effectively taking over German territory via a personal union is extremely tempting. Of course, we could just crown a member of the Jagellions or continue searching for a Hungarian heir but this is a option that would guarantee a quick heir rather then being forced to wait for the regency council to come up with a valid Hungarian heir or fall into the Bohemian Sphere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265418.A;Send a letter to the Duke of Austria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN19.T;The Hungarian Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN19.D;A envoy from the Kingdom of Hungary has unexpectedly offered the crown of Hungary to the Duke of Austria. This would effectively mean that as he is both the ruler of Hungary and Austria, we would form a union between both countries. The Hapsburg Dynasty has been looking for a greater title then that of the elective monarchy of the Commonwealth or the Duchy of Austria and the chance has finally arrived. A chance for the Dynasty to finally advance beyond its mediocre station as the Duke of Austria and into greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HUN20.D;The Austrian Duke has refused the crown of Hungary on the basis that he: "Does not want a dirty Hungarian crown from a gutter". We will have to continue our mission to find a Hungarian Heir for Hungary, rather then a foreign heir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265420.A;Such a shame;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN21.T;The Creation of Hungary-Austria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN21.D;The succession crisis that has plagued Hungary since the death of Gabor I has finally come to a end in a way that nobody could have ever hoped to expect beforehand: The Duke of Austria has been crowned in $CAPITAL$ as both the King of Hungary and the Duke of Austria, creating a union between both Hungary and Austria and effectively merging the two nations into one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265421.A;A proud moment for Hungary and the Hapsburg Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN22.T;News from Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN22.D;Hungary has been consulting with the Duke of Austria with the intent to form a "Union" between both nations. As Austria is a member state of the Holy Roman Empire and the Hungarians still own the Duchy of Nitria, it is our duty to respond in a manner which suits the prestige of our title as the Emperor and prime imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.A;Allow them. This could weaken the Revolutionaries in the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.B;The Duke of Austria must use the title: "King in Hungary".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.C;Hungary must relinquish the Duchy of Nitria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265422.D;Denied. Force them to relinquish Nitria if they ignore us..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN23.T;Interjection from Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN23.D;Bohemia has sent us a envoy stating that we must use the title: "King in Hungary" and kneel before the Holy Roman Emperor at his palace in Prague. This would be extremely humiliating internationally and it is likely that we may even be thrown out of the world stage if we did so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265423.A;Kneel and take the title of "King in Hungary";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265423.B;Go to hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265423.C;This is too hard. Find someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN24.D;Bohemia has sent us a envoy stating that we must give up the Duchy of Nitria if we wish to continue down this path. This was to be expected as Bohemia has been wanting that title returned to them ever since the Hungarian Revolution ended in the Duke of Nitria (who was a vassal of Bohemia) being crowned as the King of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265424.A;Return Nitria to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265424.B;Burn in hell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265424.C;This is too hard. Find someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN25.D;Bohemia has sent us a envoy threatening us to cease in our attempt to crown the Duke of Austria as the King of Hungary or be immediately invaded and forced to relinquish the Duchy of Nitria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265426.A;The Emperor of a dying Empire tries to stop the future. Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265426.B;This is too hard. Find someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN26.T;Hungary Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN26.D;The Hungarian Envoy has returned with inflammation regarding a barrage of insults pointed directly at the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. They have refused our ultimatum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
2654027.A;Fools! Declare War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN27.T;The Issue of Hungary-Austria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN27.D;Either though revolution or congress we have formed the Danubian Confederation. However we have been unable to fully unite all Danubian territories under our banner due to the existence of the Kingdom of Hungary-Austria, a blight on Europe. Many within Austria agree with the sentiment that Hungary-Austria was a mistake and are ready to take up arms against their government with our direct support. However, doing so risks retaliation by Hungary-Austria and since it is likely that other states in Europe are already preparing to go to war with us: adding Hungary-Austria to this mess could be very dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265428.A;Tell them that it is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265428.B;Tell them that it is time to unite with their German brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN28.T;The Austrian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN28.D;Vienna has fallen to a large group of Danubian nationalists intending to unify Austria with the newly formed Danubian Confederation. Unfortunately, before a counter-attack was possible many other cities and towns also fell which lead to our immediate withdrawal from Austria Proper. These events are likely the result of direct support by the Danubian Confederation to destroy our nation for the sake of German nationalism. If Hungary-Austria does not act decisively and declare war on these rogue Austrians, it is likely that the Union of Hungary-Austria will collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265429.A;Declare War. NOW.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265429.B;Give Up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN29.T;The Hungarian Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN29.D;The Hungarian Regency Council had been created to choose a new king for the Kingdom of Hungary and it is clear that they had attempted to impose a Jagellion onto us. However, the fact that the Regency Council had attempted to crown a Jagellion was not lost on the military and there would not even be an announcement before the military marched right into the palace and wrested control of the government from the council. The Hungarian military does not tolerate fools who attempt to pull Hungary further into the sphere of Bohemia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
265430.A;The Junta will protect us from the Bohemian Beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN30.T;Danubian Confederation Successful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HUN30.D;As we have been unable to recover Austria from the Danubian Confederation, it is practically inevitable that the collapse of this union will occur. Already there are many individuals questioning the continuation of this union in $CAPITAL$ and the government has already stated that it will be voting on the future of the union in the coming days. It is likely that they will vote Hungary-Austria out of existence since there is nobody left from Austria to continue support of this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME31511;Limited Autonomy for $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31511;We have been granted limited self-government by $FROMCOUNTRY$, in the interest of gaining our acquiescence to their formation of a Greater Germany. There are those within $COUNTRY$ who object, saying that being a German vassal is no better than what we enjoyed previously. But it is something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31515;The Greater Germany Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31515;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31516;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Petitions to Join Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31516;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. They do so with the full intent of incorporating not only their German-speaking territories, but also any lands they own belonging to other cultures. While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31518;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses German Unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31518;There has been much talk in $CAPITAL$ in recent days of possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$ into a 'Greater Germany'. This talk was finally shot down by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which stated that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s path is separate from $COUNTRY$'s. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, who believe this is unacceptable. While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. Their only stipulation on the union is that their non-German states be incorporated as self-governing regions, no doubt to minimize the objection of European powers -- though there are those who believe the European powers will be unhappy with such an arrangement even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31521;The Dissolution of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31521;Austria is no more. With Vienna gone and what remains of the Empire a disarray of governments unwilling to maintain their cohesion without an Austrian government to hold it together, the nation has split apart at the seams. Whole portions of the Empire have either declared their outright independence or their intention to reunite with their homelands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31530;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north.
