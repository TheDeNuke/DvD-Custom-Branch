violate_neutrality_desc;The Swiss may have declared themselves 'neutral', but if they believe that will stop us-- if they believe the opinion of any of their allies will stop us -- then they are sorely mistaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME123151;The Fate of Switzerland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC123151;At the conclusion of the treaty that dismantled $FROMCOUNTRY$, we have been presented a demand by Burgundy to declare neutrality and permanently dissolve all ties with the German Nation. It is the understanding of Burgundy that our existence as a element of the German nation allowed revolutionary forces to easily access Italy or Germany rather then having to go though Tirol. Additionally our existence in the German Nation had strengthened it to levels that permitted it to damage the old order. This is, and will never be acceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

return_colonies_from_dismantled_tag_desc;With the recent defeat of a colonial power, our claims to one of our colonies they own are once again at the spotlight.

EVTNAME961000;$COUNTRY_ADJ$-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonial Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC961000;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government lost the war. Their colonial empire crumbled, and our outstanding disputes with them are now solved - in our favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA961000;These are our rightful lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME96098;Colonial Dismantlement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME96099;$FROMCOUNTRY$'s Refusal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96099;The colonial partition of our enemy was proceeding according to plan. The defeated nation agreed to our demands and its colonies are being claimed by the victors. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$, however, refuse to cooperate. They claim a right to self rule and say they will not be exploited again. Our envoys returned to $CAPITAL$ with the negative answer and it seems the only way we will get $FROMCOUNTRY$ as a colony is through war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA96099;If they want war, they will have war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB96099;They are not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME96097;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96097;Our self-rule period has the possibility of ending sooner rather than never. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government sent and envoy to $CAPITAL$ with an ultimatum: as part of their peace deal with our former overlords, our nation is to be annexed as a colony of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA96097;We have no choice but to submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB96097;They will never take our freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME96095;The Fate of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96095;As the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ empire crumbles, the victorious nations divide the spoils. $COUNTRY$ was released as one of the former colonies and promised self-rule. Other Great Powers, however, already set their eyes on us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME96096;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC96096;Our diplomats secured a rounding success today in $CAPITAL$ as they managed to pry the rights to the colony of $FROMCOUNTRY$ during the last round of talks on the dismantlement of the defeated countries. The colony might rebel against our rule and fight for their independence, but our exclusive claim to it is sure to make other powers envious of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA96096;Let $FROMCOUNTRY$ welcome $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME20111;Trouble in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20111;A recent riot in $PROVINCENAME$ has brought a great deal of attention to $STATENAME$ -- the kind that would normally prompt the great powers to consider intervention. It seems, however, that the demands for independence by 'uncivilized' peoples has largely fallen on deaf ears. News of the trouble has faded away as quickly as it began.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT20111OPTA;Good. We need no interference in $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME20112;Long Memories;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20112;While recent trouble in $STATENAME$ has raised the specter of foreign intervention once again, there are many who remember the last crisis over $STATENAME$'s people as if it were yesterday. Try as they might, the world is simply not ready to listen to them again -- yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT20112OPTA;This? Again?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME20115;Incident in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20115;A demonstration by $PROVINCECULTURE$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ quickly got out of hand as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers shot into the crowd to disperse it. A riot ensued, and several protesters were slain. Throughout $STATENAME$, the reaction has been one of outrage -- and there is an effort by some $PROVINCECULTURE$ malcontents to draw the attention of the world, just one more example of $COUNTRY$'s disregard for peace and civilized behavior -- or so they'll say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVT20115OPTA;Let the world think what it likes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVT20115OPTB;Suppress this. Now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
##### HPM Canal Construction #####;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
found_suez_canal_company_title;Found the Suez Canal Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
found_suez_canal_company_desc;The prospect of building a canal in the Suez has grown a serious interest in the area and the potential profit it might bring. By establishing a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Canal Company we can assert our dominance in Egypt and get a step closer to start building the canal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seize_the_suez_canal_desc;The current owner of the Suez canal declared bankruptcy, defaulting on all their debts, including the ones they owed us.

EVTNAME36981;The Suez Canal Company;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC36981;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ investors organized in $CAPITAL$ the Suez Canal Company for the construction and maintenance of the Suez Canal. The move was made to secure the necessary influence to begin the construction works in Suez and guarantee no other great powers will interfere with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT36981OPTA;We may soon see the canal completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME36970;The Suez Canal Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36970;With the 'International Commission for the Piercing of the Isthmus of Suez' having completed and assessed the Suez region as being possible to have a canal built, all that remains is to put the plan in motion. The Suez Canal Company intends to do just that, but in order for it to start it needs to put together a significant amount of capital -- thus it has been offering shares to our government, hoping as well for the political clout to influence Egypt into allowing the venture to proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME36971;Suez Canal Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36971;On the year $YEAR$, the construction of the Suez Canal is finally finished. Numerous technical, political, and financial problems have been overcome and the final cost was more than double the original estimate. Many have died in accidents, but the canal is now finally ready for use. \n \n The opening will be performed by Khedive Ismail of Egypt and Sudan, and at Ismail's invitation our ship will be the first to cross the Canal. The opening ceremony will be held in a few days, as soon as the preparations are finished.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT36971OPTA;Glory for $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME36972;Our Ship Crosses the Suez;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36972;During the inauguration of the Suez Canal, our ship was the first ship to ever cross the Suez, bringing glory to our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT36972OPTA;As it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME36973;Our Ship Crosses the Suez;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36973;The Suez Canal, slated to be inaugurated soon, had a line of ships spending the night in line to cross the canal. The owner of the canal has the honour to have the first ship crossing the canal. But on the night before the canal was due to open, one of our Captains navigated his vessel, in total darkness and without lights, through the mass of waiting ships until it was in front of of the flagship! The canal will be open and we will be the first ones to cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT36973OPTA;They will not like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME36974;$FROMCOUNTRY$ crosses the Suez;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36974;On the night before the canal was due to open in $YEAR$, a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ captain navigated his vessel, in total darkness and without lights, through the mass of waiting ships until it was in front of our flagship. When dawn broke our officials were horrified to find that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Navy was first in line and that it would be impossible to pass them. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ captain received both an official reprimand and an unofficial vote of thanks from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Admiralty for his actions in promoting $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and for demonstrating such superb seamanship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT36974OPTA;$FROMCOUNTRY$ robbed us from our rightful glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME36975;Intervention in Egypt?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36975;We have received disturbing reports of rebellion in Egypt, on a scale where our interests in the Suez might become threatened. While it undoubtedly would appear to some that we are using this as an excuse, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government cannot idly stand by and watch such an important project be laid to waste by the ignorant. We must consider direct intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT36975OPTA;We must protect our investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT36975OPTB;There is no need for us to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME36976;The Construction of the Kiel Canal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36976;We have gathered engineers and specialists from across our country and we are ready to begin the construction of the Kiel Canal. The costs have been estimated but the we can always give them more resources to try and accelerate the construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT369706PTA;Give them more than they estimated. §R(Pay or owe 60,000¤)§W;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME36977;The Kiel Canal is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36977;The canal took years and thousands of workers to be built but today on $YEAR$, the canal was officially opened by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ruler for transiting from Brunsbuttel to Holtenau. The next day, a ceremony was held in Holtenau where the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ruler laid the final stone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT36977OPTA;The canal will greatly help $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME36978;Construction of the Panama Canal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36978;Today we will start building the Canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Our engineers are ready and a series of surveys of the area of the canal were done. The only thing left to do before we start the construction is define the budget of this colossal project. \n \n This promises to be one massive undertaking and when finished it will be, without a doubt, one of the biggest human achievements for decades to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT36978OPTA;Allow them to have as much money as they need. §R(Pay or owe 300,000¤)§W;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME36979;The Construction of the Panama Canal is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36979;The Canal cut through mountains and had to continually be widened, and the mountains slopes reduced, to minimize landslides into the canal. Steam shovels had been invented but were still not enough. Other mechanical and electrical equipment were limited in its capabilities and steel equipment rusted rapidly in the tropical climate. Several health risks posed a threat to workers in the mosquito-infested Panamanian jungle, principally malaria and yellow fever, and it claimed thousands of lives. Conditions were downplayed in $COUNTRY$ to avoid recruitment problems, but the high mortality made it difficult to maintain an experienced workforce. \n Finally, on $YEAR$ the Panama Canal was finished and it will be open to business.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT36979OPTA;This will surely help our power projection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36982;Our recent conquest of Suez led us to take over the construction of the Suez Canal. While the resources of the former owner are in the site and work on the Canal had started already, the construction will suffer a delay thanks to some damage on the site and the chaos and disorganization that arose from this ownership change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

found_diamang_desc;The first Angolan diamond was discovered in the early 20th century in the Lunda province after similar finds across the border in the Congo. By founding the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Company of Mineral Research of Angola and laying the grounds to found Diamang - the Angolan Diamonds Company and granting it the concession for diamond mining and prospecting in Angola, we might found more deposits and begin a more regular and systematic mining of the precious gems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
international_african_association_title;Found the International African Association;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
international_african_association_desc;The creation of such institutions such as the International African Association, also known as the International Association for the Exploration and Civilization of the Congo, would be a first great step to further our interests in Congo. We will invite many well-known experts, who are mainly schooled in the geographic sciences or are wealthy philanthropists. We can volunteer space in $CAPITAL$ for the International African Association's headquarters and set up national committees of the association in all the participating countries, as well as an international committee. The stated goal of the group is to discover the largely unexplored Congo and civilize its natives. Behind the scenes, however, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ is rumoured to have said "I do not want to risk... losing a fine chance to secure for ourselves a slice of this magnificent African cake". Through these associations, we can explore the Congo basin and this initiative could in the end pave the way for the creation of a Congo colony controlled by $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
congo_mining_company_title;Found the Mining Union of Upper Katanga;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
congo_mining_company_desc;"Cheap copper has no terrors for the great Mid-African mines of the Mining Union of Upper Katanga, world's biggest producer... Elements in Katanga's strength are: tremendously rich ores, cheap native labour, big production of cobalt and radium (over 82%, of world radium supply) on the side and, most recent, the newly opened Benguela Railway, which connects Katanga with the Atlantic, saves hundreds of rail miles, thousands of nautical miles for Katanga copper on its long journey to European markets."\n\nA recent article published in a famous magazine talks about the riches of the Congo. Spanish explorers found gold in the Angola river and the Ituri region, prospectors found diamonds in the Kananga region while copper, iron and other ores were found in Katanga. By founding a few mining companies such as the Mining Union of Upper Katanga, encouraging more exploration, settlement and exploitation of the Congo and by conceding incentives to the mining sector, both foreign and native, we will be able to better leverage profits out of the heart of the dark continent. We estimate a cost of §R100,000¤§W for this to be complete, and we will either pay this right now or owe it to the companies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME955184;The Congo Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC955184;During the Congo Conference, a 14-nation conference convened to submit the Congo question to international control and to finalize the colonial partitioning of the African continent. Most major powers attended the Congo Conference, and drafted an international code governing the way that European countries should behave as they acquired African territory. The conference, however, failed to recognize the International Association of the Congo's claims to the Congo and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ bids of humanitarian aid and philanthropic work fell to the pressures of economic interests and imperialism. The Great Powers of the world now scramble to, under the principle of effective occupation, acquire control over the Congo regions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT955184OPTA;We urge them to reconsider.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC955183;"$COUNTRY$ does not need a colony.

Still, you can assure His Majesty of my whole-hearted sympathy for the generous plan he had conceived, as long as the Congo does not make any international difficulties for us."\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Prime Minister has been quoted saying after European leaders officially recognized the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ control over the 2,600,000 km2 of the Congo Free State. In $YEAR$, thanks to the successful lobbying of businessman Henry Shelton Sanford at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ request, the United States decided that the cessions claimed by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ from the local leaders were lawful and recognized the International Association of the Congo's claim on the region, becoming the first country to do so. The Congo Conference officially recognized the International Congo Association and specified that it should have no connection with $COUNTRY$ or any other country, but would be under the personal control of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The great powers of Europe have been called to vote and decide on the future of the Congo: if they will concede to $FROMCOUNTRY$'s wishes, if they deny their request or if they wish to abstain from the decision. If we agree, we will be obliged to surrender any territories we currently posses in the region. Any country that owns territory in the Congo will also be asked to respect the decision of the Conference - by force if not peacefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME955191;Revolution in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC955191;With the end of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy, the fate of the Congo as the old king private possession is now uncertain. There are several bills in the Upper House about its destiny, from annexation as a colony to letting them be free. The Great Powers are not sure how to proceed as the Conference recognized the old monarch as the ruler of the Congo but our close ties and already de facto administration of it gave us a prime position in deciding its fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME955190;Civilizing Congo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC955190;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ kept his word and the Congo was ran as a philanthropic and humanitarian endeavor. He drove the slavers from the Congo basin, helped the natives modernize and civilize, he kept the Congo open for trade with all the nations. A few abuses were reported here and there, but this was usually passed as corruption or power abuse. The $MONARCHTITLE$ was never involved or held liable for those. This situation, however, led to the Great Powers closely watching the Congo and an international recognition of the Congo right to exist. This means that colonizing the Congo is a path that we can no longer trail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT955190OPTA;Our work in the Congo is almost done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME955189;The Congo Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC955189;In direct violation of his promises of free trade within the CFS under the terms of the Congo Treaty, not only had the State become a commercial entity directly or indirectly trading within its dominion, but also the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ had been slowly monopolizing a considerable amount of the ivory and rubber trade by imposing export duties on the resources traded by other merchants within the CFS. Despite all that, improvements in the Congo had been made and there was no over exploitation of the natives. Running the risk of corporations causing a humanitarian disaster because of over exploitation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ upper house decided, in a move coordinated and approved by other Great Power, to remove the $MONARCHTITLE$ as the sole personal ruler of the Congo and put it under control of $COUNTRY$ with all the legal institutions and guarantees that came with it.

EVTDESC955187;As the Congo is the private property of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$, we need to decide every three years how the country will be run for the next three years. Being too lenient and using it solely for philanthropic work might cement the country's destiny as a civilizing experiment, forever barring it from being a colony. Pushing the natives to meet the production quotas, on the other hand, might lead to abuse that can give our opposition and the humanitarian organizations some ammunition against us. While that will not hinder any plans of colonizing the Congo, it will certainly affect our reputation in the eyes of the world. The optimal solution would be maintaining balance for long enough that the philanthropic excuse doesn't collapse at the same time that our imperialistic plans for the Congo slowly become recognized and legitimized.

EVTDESC955186;With the Berlin Conference coming to an end and the great powers moving in Africa according to the principle of effective occupation, the creation of the Congo Free State became a reality and the $MONARCHTITLE$'s dominance over it was internationally recognized. The $MONARCHTITLE$ pledged to suppress the East African slave trade, promote humanitarian policies, guarantee free trade within the colony, impose no import duties for twenty years and to encourage philanthropic and scientific enterprises. Beginning in $YEAR$, however, the $MONARCHTITLE$ began to issue a series of decrees that violated these conditions. It was first decreed that the State asserted rights of proprietorship over all vacant lands throughout the Congo. Afterwards, the rights of the Congolese were reduced in their land to native villages and farms, making nearly all of the CFS crown lands. We can continue these policies which will lead to an eventual annexation, revert them or simply take control of the CFS, dealing with the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Soldiers brought them to the stations in place of rubber, they even went out to harvest them instead of rubber... They became a sort of currency. They came to be used to make up for shortfalls in rubber quotas, to replace... the people who were demanded for the forced labour gangs, and the soldiers were paid their bonuses on the basis of how many hands they collected.' The mass-deaths in the CFS became a cause célèbre in $YEAR$. The Congo reform movement led a vigorous international movement against the maltreatment of the Congolese population. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ offered to reform his regime, but international opinion supported an end to the $MONARCHTITLE$'s rule and finally, yielding to international pressure, the Upper House of $COUNTRY$ annexed the Congo Free State in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

The houses had begun to vomit terror-stricken men before even the fantastic dance of earth began. Full well did those who dwelt in the shadow of majestic but death-dealing Etna know what the artillery of the heavens portended. Science may present its theories. Those who dwell in the shadow of death have no use for them."\nAt least 91% of structures in Messina were destroyed or irreparably damaged and tens of thousands were killed.

Scores of people died while tsunamis and fires destroyed thousands of buildings.  In Edo alone, a total of about 50,000 houses and over 50 temples were either destroyed by the earthquake shaking or subsequent fires. The earthquakes were blamed on a giant catfish, Namazu, thrashing about and Ukiyo-e prints depicting Namazu became very popular around this time. The significance being that earthquakes at the time were popularly attributed to the thrashing about of a mythological catfish under the earth, normally kept under control by the deity Kashima using a large rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

After a small earthquake, there was little concern because it was so weak and many small tremors had also been felt in the previous few months. However 35 minutes later the first tsunami wave struck the coast, followed by a second a few minutes later. The waves reached a height of 38.2m and caused such damage that the event is one of the most destructive seismic events in Japanese history. The power of the tsunami was great: large numbers of victims were found with broken bodies or missing limbs. As was their normal practice each evening, the local fishing fleets were all at sea when the tsunamis struck. In the deep water the wave went unnoticed. Only when they returned the next morning did they discover the debris and bodies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

The earthquake caused significant damage over most of the coastal parts of the Iquique and Antofagasta Regions. The tsunami caused a 10m  wave along about 500km of coast, from Arica in the north to Mejillones in the south. At Arica the water reached the cathedral. The hulk of the Platagentian gunboat Wateree, which had been beached hundreds of meters inland by the final wave of the tsunami triggered by the Arica earthquake, was moved several kilometers to the north along the coast and nearer the shoreline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Then, the first wave arrived at Arica 52 minutes after the earthquake, with a 12m height, followed by the largest 16m wave 73 minutes later. The  tsunami drove three ships anchored in port nearly 800m inland: the 1560-ton Incan corvette Ameriga, the Platagentian gunboat Wateree and the Belgian store ship Fredonia, which was completely destroyed, as well as causing considerable damage in Hawaii, washing out a bridge along the Waiohi river.

This is necessary for the normal function of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state - the aristocrats are the governor generals, the privy-councillors, the high-ranking bureaucrats, the ministers, the judges and the executors of the monarch's decisions. For these functions, several government institutions exist and are populated by the landed nobility - the Committee of Ministers of $COUNTRY$, the Governing Senate, the State Council. They help draft and apply laws, manage foreign and internal policy, plan wars and administer the military, advise the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch as well as judge and administer justice. The monarch still can and has the final say in all these matters, and is his royal prerogative to do away the currently appointed aristocrats and pick new ones. By taking this step - effectively dissolving the upper house and appointing new ministers - the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch can surround himself with sycophants and petty nobility that are willing to do whatever he wants them to do - for a time, at least. This break in the unspoken agreement between the monarch and the bureaucrats, the monarch and the aristocracy, will bring consequences - besides exposing internal fractures in the government to the international community, it is sure to anger the nobles and sow confusion throughout the government ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

We can choose to boost our war efforts or strengthen the government. There are no guaranteed results, however, as our marketing might fail and even backfire. Unless, of course, the press is controlled by the state...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They owed us some money when they defaulted but since the amount is small, we wouldn't normally take any action.

EVTNAME22590;$PROVINCENAME$ Old Naval Base;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22590;A half abandoned leviathan stuck in the coast. That is how locals in $PROVINCENAME$ describe the decrepit facilities of the old naval base that used to be a local asset strategically important for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. In truth, the naval base has been in decline for a long while and the government defaulting is just the rock bottom. Hit with a severe economic recession in $YEAR$, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ politicians in $CAPITAL$ have no money to spend on repairing and maintaining non-essential staff and facilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME22592;Forts Close in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22592;If one in $YEAR$ were to look at the state of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ line of defences in $PROVINCENAME$, what they would see is a multitude of abandoned bases and unmanned fortifications occupied only by squatters. A fortification is something tricky to maintain - not only it needs regular assessment of the integrity of walls and gates, but also a constant supply of new armaments, supplies and tools for repair. If one of these ingredients are missing, the structures become useless and the military corps are powerless to stop decay from setting in. After several years of hardship, what is seen in $STATENAME$ is this picture, a consequence of the disastrous bankruptcy that is crushing $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME22591;Overgrown Railways in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC22591;What once was one of the arteries of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ industry, the railway in $PROVINCENAME$ fell into such disrepair that it's path is barely visible and its tracks are unusable. Economic recession has hit $STATENAME$ harshly for the last years and without money from $CAPITAL$ being invested, most of the railways in $STATENAME$ are in such a state that they will need to be rebuilt to become train-worthy again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

integrate_uriankhai_title;The Annexation of Tannu Tuva;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrate_uriankhai_desc;Lately, the Tannu Tuva economy has seriously deteriorated, resulting in the increasing poverty of its people. The causes were varied: declining number of fur-bearing animals probably due to over-hunting by both Uriankhais and Russians, declining number of livestock as a result of the export market to Siberia, and periodic natural disasters (especially droughts and plagues), which took a fearful toll on livestock herds. The end of Dzungar rule in Tannu Tuva brought chaos, bands of Uriankhai began plundering and burning Mongolian shops. Uriankhai nobles were divided on their course of political action. The Uriankhai governor (amban-noyon), Gombo-Dorzhu, advocated becoming a protectorate of Russia, hoping that the Russians in turn would appoint him governor of Uriankhai.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A third, more radical position of staunch protectionism, dubbed "the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ System", advocates for very high tariffs in order to develop and protect $COUNTRY_ADJ$ industry.

While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'.

The First Officer ordered the ship to be steered around the obstacle and the engines to be put in reverse, but it was too late: the starboard side struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline. Five of the ship's watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as it could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. It began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as its angle in the water became steeper. Ships in $YEAR$ were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels so Olympic only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board.
